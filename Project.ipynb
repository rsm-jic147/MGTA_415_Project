       "  'text': 'It is definitely not a watercolor book.  The paper bucked completely.  The pages honestly appear to be photo copies of other pictures. I say that bc if you look at the seal pics you can see the tell tale line at the bottom of the page.  As someone who has made many photocopies of pages in my time so I could try out different colors & mediums that black line is a dead giveaway to me. It’s on other pages too.  The entire book just seems off. Nothing is sharp & clear. There is what looks like toner dust on all the pages making them look muddy.  There are no sharp lines & there is no clear definition.  At least there isn’t in my copy.  And the Coloring Book for Adult on the bottom of the front cover annoys me. Why is it singular & not plural?  They usually say coloring book for kids or coloring book for kids & adults or coloring book for adults- plural.  Lol  Plus it would work for kids if you can get over the grey scale nature of it.  Personally I’m not going to waste expensive pens & paints trying to paint over the grey & black mess.  I grew up in SW Florida minutes from the beaches & I was really excited about the sea life in this. I hope the printers & designers figure out how to clean up the mess bc some of the designs are really cute. They just aren’t worth my time to hand trace & transfer them, but I’m sure there are ppl that will be up to the challenge.  This is one is a hard no. Going back. I tried.',\n",

No bent edges, no buckled covers, no marred printing, no mysterious liquids, & no folded pages. The book is lovely, but my continued pet peeve with books like this is the manufacturer’s insistence of printing on both sides of the damned pages. So you can’t frame one picture without losing the image on the other side. It’s annoying.  I’d gladly pay more for a book with printed images on only one side & on watercolor grade papers.  So instead I guess I will be yanking these out, scanning them, & printing them on my own watercolor papers so that I can use the images on both sides.  The paper just does not hold up to a lot of media of you choose to use both sides in my experience. Ever.  I believe I now own all, but one of JD books & I will be buying it for myself for Mother’s Day. Lol. I love her art. I love her stamps. I love this book, but I’m knocking a star bc printing on both sides is stupid imo when the book is meant to be used to create more art.  Why limit the artists by making us choose which side to use for framing or which side to use if we choose to cut one side up & decoupage it onto something. We are then paying double for half a book!  It’s insane imo. Give the buyers options other than creating more work like I mentioned with the breaking the book apart & scanning it for personal use & printing it on better papers.',\n",

Those times I will fix the mistakes. Lol.  So I’m hoping to bring myself to actually work & draw in the books. Lol.  I’m hoping she makes a lot more of them.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I really wanted to like this book bc I have her other two books, but someone got greedy. It’s half the size, but the same price.  I expected all jungle animals so finding papayas, figs, coconuts, & pineapples seems like another cop out. If I wanted a fruit book I’d have bought one!  These pages appear thinner too. You can see the images from the artwork on the other sides bleed through. I love the artist & her work, but I’m very disappointed with this book. It’s a measly 64 pages & 4 of the projects (the fruit) I will never paint in my lifetime.  There are so many animals she could have put in here like zebras, lions, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, alligators, crocodiles, & ostriches etc instead of the stupid fruit.  Poorly executed in book content & length, but lovely artwork on the good ones.  Not worth $23 ever imo.  I gave it 3 stars bc it’s not worth the price since it’s half the book of her previous ones & the content is lacking for art projects.',\n",

I burst out laughing because it was actually my youngest son’s (now 17!) book from when he was a kid. He had scrawled Joseph on the front inside cover (nearly illegible as he was 4! and only a mom would recognize it!) and Sophia was irritated thinking her little sister was disrespecting her books.  Turns out my daughter had raised my storage container looking for her Nancy Drew books, but came across Joseph’s box!  I immediately bought Sophia her own!',\n",

       "  'text': 'If you\\'re looking for a comprehensive resource for NCLEX prep, look no further...this book is fantastic. Extensive topic coverage complete with rationales for every response. Prefer going online to take quizzes? No problem this book\\'s got that, too. (Although the content online is a tad bit confusing to navigate, once you figure out how to get to the quizzes section, you won\\'t forget.) I have several books for review and this one is my personal favorite. Some of my professors loan this text out to students, but I prefer 24/7 availability in my own home! :-) Happy studying, future nurses!<br /><br />UPDATE: I saw sooo many reviewers having trouble getting to the online content to take system-specific quizzes that I decided to post instructions here on how to get to the right place.<br /><br />1) Go to the Pearson Pegasus log-in page once you\\'ve set up online access, and log in.<br />2) Click on the book title on the left side of the website.<br />3) On the next page, on the left side near the top, you will see a menu bar that has the following options: \"Today\\'s View, Course Content, Grades, Communicate\". Look just BELOW this menu bar and you will see the following options: \"View All Content, Course Calendar, Learning Objectives.\"<br />4) Click on Learning Objectives.<br />5) On the left side, you will see the following options: \"Client Need, Topics Areas, Integrated Process.\"<br />6) To take quizzes related to your system or topic of choice, click the plus sign for \"Topics Areas\".<br />7) Click on your system of choice.<br />8) On the right side, there are several options for that topic of study. Scroll down to the bottom-ish. You will see a heading called \"Self Study\" for that topic of study. Click on it.<br />9) A separate pop-up window will appear so that you may begin your quiz.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to comment below. Note that the online quiz portion only works with Internet Explorer and certain versions of Firefox, but not with Chrome.',\n",

The chapters are short and weave in and out the story as it touches the lives of characters.  While getting close to the end, I put the book down for a week because I didn't want the book to end - it kept me hooked.  I don't do that with books, leave it alone to take small bites but this one I did.  The author herself is interesting; she is a journalist and served as a BBC news presenter.  Story telling is her way to decompress from the crimes she reported and reports on which I find truly remarkable and commendable.  She's a great author, contributor and story telling artist.

I used it a couple times during the hikes to read the descriptions and make sure I was still going the right way as many different trails intercross as some point.  The GPS coordinates also helped for us to arrive at the parking areas, especially for Whiteoak Canyon Trail that has an entrance not off of skyland drive and we had no cel phone service.

       "  'text': \"Cool Wind's Gate by Wayne Bernard Sr.<br /><br />Many books and stories  written about the  antebellum  south and Louisiana in particular,  usually  tell one of two tales... a life of ease and prosperity  on a  grand plantation or the atrocities committed against those same men and women in bondage whose slave labor enabled the life of ease and prosperity.  Cool Wind's Gate though, while still set in pre-civil war Louisiana, gives a different accounting, a better way that could have been, one that I wished as I was reading it were true.<br /> The story of Cool Wind's Gate grew out of the belief that slavery  was wrong.  Mr.  Clem Collins of Wisteria plantation  knew that to simply liberate his slaves wasn't enough.  Without a means to care for  their families and lacking protection from the prejudices and cruelty of the outside world  it would do little good to set them free to starve or worse.  He had  a plan though, a broader vision of how a good life could be had by everyone.  A life filled with well-earned respect, dignity and love.  And Clem had Will Trahan, who would see to it that the vision of self-sufficiency and autonomy would become the reality.<br /> Cool Wind's Gate is written simply in a straightforward way.  I would have liked  more descriptive features  of the book's characters,  but at almost 900 pages,  the author gives us a very authentic story.\",\n",

I recounted several times and even tried several ways of adding things up but my end count remained the same. I assume that I misunderstood the sparse directions which were not clear.

Truly an emotional account, the reader is thrust back in history to one of the most horrific times one can imagine to be living in Italy.

Having visited most of the main cities several times (Rome, Florence, Venice), I was looking for a guide to assist me in looking for off-the-beaten path sites. I love this Lonely Planet guide. It is informative, beautifully illustrated and has many maps to help me get around as a single traveler. I have owned several Lonely Planet guides and I am never disappointed with the up to date and comprehensive information you get from them. It is convenient enough for me to carry in my purse, yet with enough information to be the only guide I will need. Kudos to Lonely Planet for another great travel guide! I highly recommend it for anyone looking to rent a car and travel into some of the lesser known areas of Italy.',\n",

I had googled the internet to try to find where these places were and was only able to find one of them. I had figured that I would need to get to Rome and ask someone in the hotel (in my very broken Italian) where it was that I needed to go. In comes the Lonely Planet guide to Rome. First thing I did was go to find the locations I couldn't find anywhere else. As it turns out, the meet-up places I had been looking for were actual 'local aliases' that if you were a Rome resident you would know. The Lonely Planet guide had these listed both ways and I was not only able to read about the locales, but also locate them on the enclosed street maps. Kudos to Lonely Planet and their terrific tourist guides. I had used them before in Paris and Ireland, but never had needed them like I did this time. And forgetting all this personal information I needed, rest assured there is plenty of other tourist info like entry times and fees for tourist sites and reviews on restaurants as well. If you are going to Rome,  you need to bring this with  you!\",\n",

The book is a perfect size for travelers, recommending some wonderful restaurants in the cities (some of which I will also be trying in October)and many little known towns and tourist attractions (in addition to the more well known Florence/Pisa/Lucca/Sienna attractions. The pictures are beautiful, maps are all inclusive and the guide is written in clear English (to assist when in the areas where some may not speak the language).

It was informative and the maps and pictures were wonderful. With my limited knowledge of the Italian language, it was nice to have a guide, in English, which explained details of things (i.e. pubic transportation, hours of operation for museums and sightseeing, fees, etc). As a matter of fact, I used the bus almost exclusively when I was in Lucca to get to the airport and the city of Pisa and the Lonely Planet guide helped me with everything I needed to know. I used to be a Fodor's fan for travels in the past. However, I will now be purchasing the Discover series for whenever I go abroad (in fact, Discover France is next on my list for 2012).

To be honest, I hate manuals and instructions. I was hoping this would have been more of a tutorial (like excel for dummies), but I found it somewhat complicated. I guess if I was looking to do a particular feature, I could look for it in the index and follow the instructions. But, I really was looking for more a tutorial that could step me through how to make more robust spreadsheets. If you are more technology savy than I am, this book may work for you.

It could provide Instructional Designers a reference to provide faculty who are questioning the process and over all course design.<br /><br />The book covers a wide variety of areas to assist the course development process and more importantly how you will then use the course to teach effectively to students. It doesn't get to far into the weeds so if you need that level of fidelity then this isn't the best book for you (Experienced Moodle users moving from 2.x to 3.x version).  Additionally, if you're experienced the beginning of each chapter on a bit of instructional design/pedagogy  might put you off. I personally like the reminders as an Faculty Developer and Educational Technologist. Sometimes you just need to review the how and why to get better.<br /><br />I like how the author has gotten into Workshops and Portfolios, two the least used modules I've seen implemented by faculty at 3 decent sized institutions. She provides explanations on why and how to use these sections to get most every one started and follow ups with examples on how to use them to further the learner's engagement<br /><br />It's a good starter book for Moodle course design and implementation. Don't count on reading cover to cover in a day or so. But each chapter allows the reader the ability to jump to an area you need assistance with.\",\n",

I use cookbooks to learn new methods, new ideas and to inspire myself.  This cookbook is one of THE best cookbooks I've purchased in years.  Great recipes.  Great ideas. And LOADED with pictures!!  The recipes are not hard and really creative.  Everything is laid out over the picture about ingredients - pictures of the ingredients even!  breakfast options, soups, sandwiches and salads, main dishes, sauces, sides and desserts - plus nutritional info. Nothing is missing and there is something for every taste.  It's amazingly well put together, so well thought out.  Exactly how I would put a cookbook together if I were ever asked - no joke.  Honestly, in my opinion, if you're to go more to or are already there, this IS the cookbook for you.  The only thing I would say is that I wish the binding was spiral backed - usually a deal breaker for me.  But I am SOOOO glad I threw all in and purchased anyway!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it\",\n",

I plan to share the paperback with someone else who may need it when I am done.  I purchased this title and another one, victory over vestibular migraine and I like victory better - but as I am just in the learning mode, I am looking at a lot of titles.

This is a diagnosis for me so I am busy collecting all the info I can.  This is the book I go back to again and again - especially right now when I am just learning how to live with this diagnosis. On the cooking section,  I need photos when I cook anything - and -  this  so much more than a cookbook - but when you get to the recipe sections the photos are plentiful and beautiful.  Lots and lots of them.  This book as a whole is worth every single penny.  As I get through some of the recipes I will check back in if it seems an update of my review would be helpful.  They seem reasonable for anyone who has a general understanding of how to cook - no julia childs or martha stewart like stuff as far as I can see.  I fold down corners of the recipes I want to try in all my books and this one is almost entirely folded!',\n",

First, spiral back - this means the book will stay open as you're looking.  Bright, beautiful pictures on every single page.  The paper is shiny - better than a matte paper that absorbs more quickly.  Easy to more complex (but not impossible) recipes.  I am sort of a cookbook collector and this one tics all the spots for me - there are some recipes I'm familiar with and others I would like to try.  I use a cookbook for inspiration/ideas - so this is fabulous with all the full color photos.  Honestly, I purchased 2.  One for myself and one for a Christmas book exchange.  Hopefully someone who loves to collect cookbooks as much as I do will get it!\",\n",

I wish there was a way to search/organize the recipes in the amount of time it takes to cook in the crock pot... that would help when you're looking at options - like the least amount of time at the front, the most time in the crockpot in the back?  I don't know.  There are 8 full color pictures in the center of the cookbook - I guess better than nothing, but I really love more pictures.  Really good - the book has a spiral back.  That means it will stay open as you're using it.  Down side, be careful, as the paper the book is printed is very much like a papertowel (meaning absorbs everything) matte, not shiny.. you get my drift...  I love cookbooks and own many - even though I also search online options as well.  Doesn't replace the cookbook in your hand in my opinion.  This one is good if you don't own ANY crockpot recipe books.\",\n",

I haven't found any strange ingredients (meaning you can't find what you need at the local grocery store - as we live in a small rural town) and no super special pieces of kitchen equipment... so I consider that a bonus.  I am not a trained culinary chef and I manage to understand the process of these recipes... I am a fan of one pot cooking (in all fairness some of the recipes use more than one pot - but served in one bowl..), so this book appealed to me.  I like the Red Bean Gumbo (however I replace the green bell pepper with a red bell pepper as I am not a fan of green bell pepper and I omit the okra - not a fan of that either)...  very satisfying. In the book it mentions that &#34;gumbo&#34; is the African word for okra!  Hmm... I like gumbo... but sans the okra. haha.  In any case, I purchased this cookbook and a handful of others to help inspire me to try to eat vegan.

One of our favorites is the peanut butter banana pancakes...  There are a lot of recipes using what you would expect... black beans, quinoa, lentils and the usual veggies and some nuts.  Honestly, if you're looking to venture into the possibility of a vegan diet, out of the 4 books I ordered, this one is the one I usually reach for.  Book and movie reviews are very subjective, and I get that.  I try to be as helpful as I can when reviewing such items.\",\n",

I will say that most of the recipes don't really interest me - but I just tweak them to work for me and sometimes it helps to have some inspiration when dealing with new ways of eating.  It does also give you some lists of high and low FODMAP foods, which can be helpful when starting out. There are pictures too, which is always helpful when looking at food.

This book often mention concept without clear explanations,  or it referes it far back, reads more like an afterthought.<br /><br />- missing code: the chapter talks about SQLite, without actual sample code distributed. I saw a message in so-called and much touted Author\\'s forum asking for it, but there is no reply whatsoever for couple of months. what good is it for author forum if the author(s) don\\'t read it nor respond to it?<br /><br />- write a subject without teaching - Multimedia is such a chapter: it suppose to teach you how to control the camera/audio/video and make a app out of it. There are a variety of important concept to understand such as SurfaceView, holder etc. to understand it. That chapter didn\\'t provide ANY explanation for it. It give you a few segments of code, dotted with a few typical manning\\'s 1,2,3 comments, that is it. There is absolutely no way to grasp it by reading it.

You won't be able to put the book down right from that start and you'll find yourself thoroughly immersed in this life journey compressed into a week's time. Young Jack and Fran lead a quest that deepens the lives of everyone they touch as they are mysteriously chosen to find the Holy Grail - or are they lost in a crazy fantasy world? - that may be hidden somewhere on their beautiful and majestic stone-Gothic campus. It is a story for our day as well as one for all time.\",\n",

For the literary, it's full of metaphorically rich prose flowing polished from his pen. For the young, it's a gothic mystery about love and longing and the quest to unravel life's mysteries while learning about love, ancestral teachings, power, and sacred truths--told through the eyes of modern-day Nikki and her ancestral mother Anne. For those not so young, it gifts the exciting rhythm of youth tempered by wisdom perhaps not yet acquired. It is also a tightly crafted contemporary novel with captivating depth about olden ways full of lessons for modern morass. Arcing through post-stormy-passages poetic rainbows reveal insights about men and women, science and religion, sacredness and truth, and learning to live with the constraints we are dealt.\",\n",

Lexi does an amazing job of allowing the reader to see life through her eyes and what’s in her heart, using insight, hope and tons of humor!  Thank you Lexi, for being brave enough to share your story with all of us.  It is also an important book to help educate parents and physicians of the incredible importance of being aware of high levels of bilirubin when a child is born and to get them treatment immediately.

Each subject is usually just a few pages long so it\\'s the kind of book you can keep in the bathroom to read a little bit a time :-).

       "  'text': 'Beverly Cleary’s books were some of the first ones I read independently. The Art of Ramona Quimby brought back so many memories of these books. When the editions illustrated by Tracy Dockray came out, I did wonder if the updated, modern illustrations would work with the original book texts, many of which were written in the ‘50s and ‘60’s. I was unaware until I read this book that yet another edition of Cleary’s books had been released in 2013.. It seems to work; children are still grabbing these books in 2020!<br />The Art of Ramona Quimby focuses on the one character of Cleary’s that had books published about her from the 1950’s all the way in to the ‘90’s. The author did a marvelous  job of taking readers through the decades with  this beloved little girl.  The letters of correspondence between Cleary and the first illustrator, Louis Darling, were a special added bonus. I would recommend this to anyone who has ever enjoyed  Ramona’s adventures through the years.<br />I hope Anna Katz will someday write another book about  the art of some of Cleary’s other characters!<br />Thank you, Netgalley, for providing me with a free copy of this outstanding book. I have a feeling that I’ll be buying a hard copy very soon!',\n",

       "  'text': 'This book will definitely  be going on my “Best Of 2020 “ list! It was beautifully written historical fiction, set in the 1950’s in the Deep South. There was a nostalgic feel, due to the author’s attention to details like television sets in store windows, women dressed up in gloves and hats to visit town, icy-cold Cokes bought at the general store on a summer day.  There was an underlying tension beneath the innocence, however; in several places I found myself holding my breath as I read.<br />I loved this story with its message of the power of true friendship. It also shows how destructive predjudice and hatred can be, when people use the excuse, “That’s the way things have always been” to justify it.<br />A wonderful book for Y.A. readers, with adult guidance. Due to the setting, some words are used and attitudes expressed which would be offensive in today’s society. If history teachers use this book in their classrooms, as I would recommend, it could be a great teaching tool about how things have changed for the better since the Civil Rights Movement.<br />**Thank you, Netgalley, for honoring my request for this book in exchange for an honest review! All opinions are strictly my own.**',\n",

       "  'text': \"figure 1st sentence: &#34;I suck at predicting the future, and I am so not the queen of witty comebacks.&#34;<br />Dani had not foreseen that Max, a boy that she's been good friends with, would suddenly ax their relationship. His grandmother and her Grandma Beans have been locked in a feud for decades, so Dani is sure that's the reason behind Max's strange behavior. What she doesn't know, and what no one will discuss with her, is WHY the two women, formerly best friends, now despise each other. Her chances to get information are slipping away, literally. Her beloved grandmother is in the last, worst stages of Alzheimer's, unable to communicate. However, any time the name of Avadelle Richardson, &#34;the enemy&#34; , or the topic of &#34;The Feud&#34; comes up, Grandma cries and gets agitated. Dani is sure that her grandmother does not want to pass on with the bitterness between the friends still strong. If Dani can only figure out what caused the rift, she is sure she can get the two ladies to patch things up... before it's too late.<br />Especially liked: The Mississippi setting, with the university &#34;Ole Miss&#34; as a major factor. It had quite a notorious reputation in the 1960's, and not for positive reasons. I knew the bare facts about James Meredith and his attempt to enroll in 1962. I really had no idea that the rioting and chaos this caused is considered the pivotal point of the Civil Rights Movement. I learned so much about the events at &#34;Ole Miss&#34; and how they affect life there even today.<br />Memorable scenes/quotes: Indri, whose name means &#34;lemur&#34; in Hindi, is described by Dani as getting &#34;lemur eyes&#34; any time she is stressed. (Pg. 224): The university librarian is likened to a ninja, because she never smiles and always dresses in black. ( Chapter 17 and 18): The adventure in Dr. Harper's office! (pg. 515): Ms. Wilson, dealing with stacks of neighbor-delivered food,&#34; Dear God, Southern people don't know what else to do for death except cook it away.&#34;<br />Overall Reaction: I think this would be a wonderful tool for learning more about the Civil Rights Movement of the '60's. I definitely did, and highly recommend it for middle grade and Y.A. readers.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"An eleven-year-old girl and her sisters are traumatized by a murder which takes place at a convenience store in their neighborhood. Maggie actually becomes very OCD after this incident The story is told from her viewpoint.  She begins to repeat things in her head twice, count things and has to have the number even, checks constantly for the robber. Maggie thinks he is literally everywhere and will &#34;shoot her in the head or heart, any minute.&#34;<br />Overall Reaction: This book is disturbing. The description on Amazon was better than the book turned out to be. Maggie is portrayed as a child that is experiencing serious mental health issues. Since it's written in first-person, her anxieties and rituals overwhelm the story. The character development was also lacking. Each character has one trait pointed out about them, and what is revealed is not flattering. For example, the author hints at the mom being fat, the dad has skinny arms and is short; little sister has a ponytail she nervously chews on. The older sister is  portrayed as being only a very moody teenager; even friends are not written about in detail. I would best say the writer's style is rather blank and empty. This book left me feeling anxious.<br />One More Thing: Usually minor swear words don't bother me too much, particularly in Y.A, fiction. However, the F-Word is a huge turn-off for me, in life as well as in literature. This book had a child saying F-Off several times. Even though abbreviated with a hyphen, I found this very inappropriate, especially since this supposedly geared toward younger readers.\",\n",

Zoe's &#34;codes&#34; were difficult to read and I found myself skimming over them. This was a strange ability for the author to give a character who wants badly to fit in with her peers. The concept of students calling their teachers by their first names was weird, even in a private school setting. There was some character development that was attention catching, but not necessarily in a positive light. Zoe's little brother is portrayed as an extremely obnoxious child. He is cared for by a nanny, because the parents are completely wrapped up in their careers and in their own lives.

I really came to understand why Tree's father felt as he did about this.

I was disappointed because it turned out to be more a story of a 13 year-old's life in 1960's Louisiana. The &#34;Cheerleaders&#34; and Ruby were like a secondhand storyline. The plot was much more involved with the details of the interaction between the mother, Louise the teenage daughter, and the way male companions treated them both.

His endless literary and historical references added little to the story at hand.  Calpurnia?  We see her for about two pages -- disappointing.  And Atticus?

       "  'text': \"At first glance, I thought a book about a &#34;magic pencil&#34; would be very silly and childish. I could not have been more mistaken! I began to love the character of Ava as soon as the plot reveals that she is a worry-wart that thinks &#34;what-if&#34; questions to herself constantly. I could relate so well; I did that myself in school and it's still a habit I struggle with as an adult.  I found it endearing that Ava worries about her family far more than herself. She is a book character that I would long to be friends with in real life, if only so we could reassure each other that things will turn out for the best!  The way in which the author had Ava conquer her fears was really superb; I wanted to keep cheering her on as she progressed through the obstacles ( I probably would have given out a lot quicker than Ava did!) All told, this is a wonderful book to read and it's going in my Amazon cart. I would highly recommend it, especially to all the &#34;worry-warts&#34; and &#34;what-ifers&#34; out there!\",\n",

I have read every single other book about Kit several times, and enjoyed them all, mainly due to the fact that they were set in the Great Depression.  Well- written historical fiction is my favorite type of book to read. This book makes only one reference to the Depression, literally only one sentence. If I was not familiar with Kit's character already, I would not have known what the setting was, due to the lack of historical references. There is very little continuity between the events and characters in the former books and this one. Lastly, the concluding &#34;Peek Into the Past&#34; section, always present in the other Kit mystery books, has been reduced to two pages and no historical photographs. If this is what the content and format of the &#34;Beforever&#34; books is going to be like, I doubt seriously if I will buy any more.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I discovered this series of books at the library.\" Dear Pen Pal\" was the first one that I read (it\\'s actually third in the series), and I was hooked! I could hardly wait to read the others, because references were made about events from the first two books in \"Pen Pal\".  I\\'ve now read all five, including \"Home for the Holidays\".  This is a great series of books, especially for this day and time. There are no instances of smoking, drinking, or sex. The characters have crushes, and an occasional kiss, but that\\'s as far as it goes.(Very unusual for recently written books!)  The characters are modern teenagers who all have endearing as well as annoying qualities. Their personalities and interests are varied, but they are still friends and share the common bond of being in the book club with their moms. I especially liked how the moms and grandmoms that were in the club were involved with and cared about all of the girls, not just their own offspring.<br />  I think this series would appeal to readers of the Baby-Sitter Club books.  Girls who have enjoyed those books but are ready for a more challenging reading level would find \"The Mother-Daughter Book Club\" to be very interesting and easy to relate to, in my opinion. Hopefully, girls will be also be inspired to read or re-read books by Alcott, Austen, Montgomery and Lovelace, and perhaps even begin their own clubs. Thanks to Ms. Frederick for writing this wonderful series! I hope there are more books in the future!',\n",

I had never heard before that some Caucasian ministers of Japanese churches followed their congregations to internment camps. Talk about living out your faith! Kirby Larson is a wonderful writer, as proved by the success of Hattie Big Sky, which is also a great read. I recommend \"Fences\" to any history buff, and I believe this book could hook even an anti- history person into enjoying it!

       "  'text': 'When I did have to stop reading this book over the past 48 hours, I could hardly wait to get back to it!  I enjoyed Melissa\\'s memories about the different episodes. On reading about the \"May We Make Them Proud\" episode, I found it interesting that both Melissa and I agreed that if a mother was by her baby\\'s cradle and a fire started, she would GRAB THE BABY (as she tried to point out to Landon during filming)!(That was a L.H. that I remember as being very \"dark\" and quite frightening,as I was 9 years old back in 1979).<br />  Anyway, this book was like a walk down memory lane in the 70\\'s, with the songs that Melissa listened to, the clothing and hairstyles, and of course the memories about Little House! I liked the fact that the title was true to the book\\'s contents. When I read \"Prairie Tale\" by Melissa Gilbert, I thought it would have many more details about her L.H. experiences, as the title suggests. I ended up forcing myself to finish it, after wading through the VERY sordid details of her many romances. Way too detailed, in my opinion! \"The Way I See It\" was not written as a tell-all book. Melissa came across to me as a rather shy, gentle person who wanted to share her memories of this particular period in her life with her fans. She seems to be a person I could sit across from and enjoy sharing 70\\'s memories and \"mom stories\" with, since her son is exactly one year and nine days older than my son!<br />  I highly recommend this book to any Little House fan, especially those who grew up with the show in the 70\\'s like I did. Great job, Melissa! I enjoyed your book thoroughly and will read it more than once, I guarantee!',\n",

       "  'text': \"Read a couple of Peter Helton's Chris Honeysett books first and really enjoyed them, then I read Four Below featuring DI Liam McClusky.  The two characters are so different and the general tone of the books is too. The Honeysett books are light and fun and have quirky, arty characters who dabble at crime solving and muck about with unreliable cars and ever so slightly shady characters.  McClusky on the other hand is a professional investigator, but he is also wonderfully flawed, quirky but not arty, follows his insightful hunches doggedly to an excellent nail biting resolution.  I would summarize the Honeysett character books as great snacks and Four Below (the only McClusky book I have read) as a totally enjoyable full meal of a mystery story.  I love mysteries and think Helton's books was very well done.  Four Below would make a great movie and I can't wait to read more McClusky mysteries!\",\n",

I thought the author did a good job of realistically portraying the emotional reactions of each family member during this life-changing event and portraying how the experience is different for each of them.  He explored the issue of survivor's guilt, including touching on risk-taking behavior.  His male characters were well developed and real but he also did a good job etching both the determination and grittiness of strong women as well as portraying their emotional vulnerability.  All-in-all, I really enjoyed this book.  The story flowed well, was taut and I wasn't disappointed at the conclusion.  I look forward to further novels from Tim Johnston.\",\n",

As a young girl, I was very interested in Margaret Mead's work as an cultural anthropologist.  She was a role model and hero for me.  A woman who chose to go off exploring the world's most primitive cultures in untamed wilderness.<br />Lily King writes beautifully, she has created well-developed, very human characters with strengths and weaknesses and both higher and baser desires.  This is an interesting story with, very believable, conflict and tension.  The conclusion of the novel is satisfying in a real-life, yet surprisingly suspenseful way.  I would definitely read another book by Lily King and recommend this to anyone who enjoys well done historical fiction.\",\n",

The first was a little disappointing, as it left out too much about the community it told about.  This one, however, seems to be quite complete.  Brought back many memories.  Should be interesting reading even for someone who never went to the park.  We had Legend City for 20 years, but now 30 years later after it\\'s demise, this remains the largest city in the country without a theme park and the book explains probably why that is.

       "  'text': \"At only 167 pages, this is a quick easy read, which I liked because I don't have a lot of time to read.  The author packs a lot into those pages.  He covers 5 common sayings that Christians sometimes say or believe, but aren't really quite what the Bible says or what Jesus taught.  I won't list them here, as they are in the product description.  One of the things that struck me is that God does not control us like puppets and everything is not predestined.  We have free will, but neither does he set us totally free to stumble along through life without any help  The author believes that the truth is somewhere in between where God is more like a parent, guiding when we want help or need it.  Not every thing in life is micromanaged by God.  God probably doesn't care if you pick corn, peas or carrots as your vegetable for a meal.  Another important point - God does not promise life to be free of trouble, pain or temptation, but instead promises to be there for us to help us get through it.  There are so many other good points in this book that I can't even list them all in a short review.  I think this book is a MUST READ for Christians and interesting reading for those who are not, because they might have heard some of the 5 sayings from Christians and now they can understand why and what the true meaning of the scripture is and where these half truths came from.  I don't read very many &#34;religious&#34; books, but this was well worth the time to read it.  It is never boring and he gives a lot of stories and a little humor from time to time as well.\",\n",

I suppose there is a certain amount of usefulness in the set as well as the quirky fun aspect.  Who doesn't need a pencil sharpener, an eraser, a ruler, note pads and some stickers.  Everyone needs a banana bookmark and a cow head eraser!!!!  Not sure what I would use the sand timer for, but someone might have a use for it.  Kids might enjoy it too, but the box says not intended for children and says 14 years old and up.  What kid wouldn't love a cow head eraser or a banana bookmark?  And every kid loves stickers.  There are not a lot of stickers here though.  The sand timer might be only thing you wouldn't want to give them, as it is glass and could break and cause cuts.  The box itself that holds everything is a nice sturdy flip top box--nothing chintzy about it.  The box is worth keeping, unlike cheap boxes that fall apart quickly.  It is made of very heavy cardboard.  Just a great fun item to own or give as a fun gag gift.  There aren't many gag gifts as useful as this.\",\n",

Even with very basic information, it doesn\\'t feel like it is \"dumbed-down\", so even those who have used Windows for years will still be able to make good use of the book to understand how Windows 8 works and how different it is than prior versions.  The book probably was written from early releases or a BETA version, as it talks about things you can do with Media Center (such as playing a DVD).  From what I know, Media Center was not initially part of the Win 8 release and is a separate add-on.  I believe Media Center may be included now, as least in the downloaded Win 8 version, but I am not sure it installs automatically; the book makes it sound as if it is an integrated part of Win 8.  Since I don\\'t actually have Windows 8 yet, I couldn\\'t verify the accuracy of other information in the book.  I got the book thinking I was going to upgrade one of my computers, but then found out the hardware can\\'t handle a Win 8 upgrade.  The only real problem I have with the book is that it won\\'t stay open by itself so that you can refer back and forth from computer to book or book to computer. A spiral binding would have been preferable.  Other than a few possible inaccuracies and the problem with the binding, I really think you will like this book.  Has a good index in the back.  Total of 340 pages, packed with information on how to get up and running with Windows 8.  Save the cost of a training course and buy the book.  I believe anyone can learn Windows 8 from this book.  Copious illustrations and numbered steps make the book easy to follow and make it fun to learn.',\n",

The only problem I found with it is that the author goes into so much background on some of the characters that it can get a little tiresome.  Get on with the story already!  It takes 4 chapters just to get to the plane crash.  Then after the tale real starts to unfold, there are one or two digressions into backgrounds of other people involved.  There was one person who I have yet to figure out how he fits into the story, even though the author devotes almost a full chapter to that person.  Other than this one shortcoming of the book, the story absolutely pulls you in and you can't wait to find out how it is going to end.  You never lose interest, even with the digressions into character backgrounds.  An adventure story in the truest sense of the word and well worth reading.  Never boring; just a bit tedious at times when you want things to move faster.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The sometimes secret and shadowy world of puppy mills is exposed by this book. You will be shocked at the horrendous way that some breeders treat their dogs.  As sad as the situation was and in some cases still is, the book shows that with a lot of money, patience and care, some puppy mill dogs can be restored to reasonable health and happiness.  Some can never be restored after years of abuse and neglect.  The physical abuse is bad enough, but puppy mill dogs suffer immense emotional abuse as well.  Only through the efforts of caring people can these places be shut down.  Many have been stopped with stronger legislation and the efforts of caring people, but I think the book makes it clear that we have to be ever watchful and not do things that allow the puppy mills to flourish.  Adopt an animal from a local humane society and don't insist on a purebred.  Mixed breed dogs are often just as wonderful than full breeds.  They tend to be healthier and often have better dispositions.  The book is an easy read at just 200 pages in my advance copy.  It's a good book for high school kids who might want to get active in protecting animals.  Younger children might be able to read the book easily, but could be disturbed by the terrible treatment that is described in the book.  A must read for any adult who cares about dogs and animals.  At the end of the book is also information on how you can get involved and make a difference.  Very well written and hard to put down.  You may well read it in a single sitting.\",\n",

The book is categorized on Amazon as being for teens and the book suggests ages 12 & up and grades 7 & up.  Since it is not overly lengthy (just under 200 pages of easily readable, nicely spaced type), a teen could read through it in a short time and wouldn't be overwhelmed by it.  The question is whether or not they would find it interesting enough to truly enjoy it and want to finish it.  Perhaps.  On the plus side, I did learn a few things about the assassination that I either I had forgotten or did not know to begin with.  Not having read that much about Lincoln, am not sure if there is anything new here.  For a teen who is very interested in Lincoln, it would probably be a good addition to their library.  There are about 30 pages of historic pictures throughout the book, which make it far more interesting.  This is a good book for anyone who has trouble reading tiny print now (such as myself), due to the very readable, nicely spaced type style.  If this is your first Lincoln assassination book, it is probably a good start to acquaint you with the details, but you'll probably want to read a longer, more in-depth book if the topic really interests you or you are researching it.\",\n",

Some reviewers found it too detailed, but I thought the initimate details of the lives of the parties involved made this much more enjoyable than if it had been just a book about horseracing.  Some say the first section of the book is slow.  Perhaps so, but I found it interesting and enjoyable and a nice foundation to finally introducing the horse. Includes a fascinating look at the hard life of jockey\\'s in the 30\\'s & 40\\'s.  Worth reading just for that.  Inspiring, emotional, heartwarming story that will have you in tears at times.  Hildebrand knows how to grab the reader and never let go.  Yes, it may be a little syrupy, preachy and overdone at times, but always enjoyable and never boring.  Not many writers could appeal to such a wide audience in a book that is supposedly about horseracing.  It is so much more than a \"horse\" book.  It is really about a team of unlikely people and animals who on their own were failures and worth very little, but as a team came together to produce one of the most enduring legends in American history.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I just finished this book and was sorely disappointed, I had such high hopes. The story telling was mediocre at best, expending far too much focus on highly repetitive intervals (looking at dating websites, casual sex with strangers, gossiping about these two things to friends constantly - even when it means losing her work and home, all she cares about are the men). Then there is a rush at the very last leg of the book to tie everything up in a very forced and very happy ending which makes absolutely no sense if you actually read the entire story. Worse, there is so much racism in this book and it's not coming from the 'white folk' as it is set up to appear, but from the main character and her tiny circle of friends.<br /><br />Spoiler warning.<br />Our main character (MC) is apparently one of only five black people in all of London. Black people are so scarce in London that anywhere our MC goes everyone is riled up at her presence even when she is doing nothing. Everyone has an extreme reaction to the MC of which she and her friends constantly mock white people for. Yes, this book abuses the trope that white people are evil and racist and only out to fetishize black women over and over and over again.<br /><br />The MC's entire preoccupation spans three months of casual sex with over 30 random strangers while her real relationship is on pause for 90 days where she was supposed to work on herself to be a better emotional partner. 95% of this book is the MC looking at dating apps while yearning for her white boyfriend and hooking up with whomever will give her time. And then she goes back to her friends and they make fun of the white people's reaction to this and the white people's reaction to that.<br /><br />We watch her bounce to and from the gynecologist's office where she keeps getting std and pregnancy tests due to all the unprotected promiscuity, and the MC's decline psychologically as she develops panic attacks. We watch her fail at just about every relationship in her life but she doesn't ever see it that way. We watch her struggle but never grow, never learn from her mistakes, never become a better person than she was at the beginning of the book. She has no interests, no hobbies and no drive beyond how much (censored) she can get. It's actually unsettling how flat and one dimensional the MC is, she literally has no will to live beyond men and their genitals.<br /><br />This book is trying to send a message and it fails miserably. MC sets up situations time and again with people and then claims she is a victim of racism. She repeatedly complains about being fetishized throughout the entire book, but every situation with a man she is all about the sex and letting them do whatever they like to her even if it degrades her. The irony is that she almost exclusively selects white men as her partners and refuses to get with a black man at all.<br /><br />The author even managed to work the Black Lives Matter catalyst and movement into the story but all it was used for was a mini argument between the MC and one of her many one night stands and never again mentioned instead of using it to send out a powerful message (such as the march scene suggested it might be). I would say, if anything, this book is an illustration of what is exactly wrong with trying to counter racism with further racism. Maybe just stop as a whole.\",\n",

It has made a tremendous difference in my approach to (and actually completing) story writing.  I didn't need another book to supply me with yet another method to write my story, but I was curious as to what this book could offer me as a snowflaker.<br /><br />As I read through the Save The Cat! book, I couldn't help but see how both books perfectly compliment one another and together could give indispensable wisdom and suggestions.  While the Snowflake Method is about starting with a single sentence concept (your story synopsis) and branching out until you have such a strong grasp on your story and a detailed scene list to write from, Save the Cat! explores stages of your story and how to transition between them with clear and easy to understand break-downs of what is being conveyed.  If the Snowflake Method is the skeleton upholding the story structure, Save The Cat! is the meat padding those bones and giving better shape to your tale.<br /><br />I think this is a great resource for any level - from experienced writer to novice.  It can be useful as a standalone or in conjunction with another method you may feel comfortable using.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in writing a story.\",\n",

It's on of those &#34;this is what I did&#34; - with a lot of repetition of what the author did which begins to feel like filler rather than explanation -while only superficially detailing suggested steps (none of which explain how to type faster while writing a book).<br /><br />The author probably achieved his goal of making his book a best seller with the promises on the cover of being able to teach any reader how to write 2k words per hour, but there is nothing to substantiate these claims.  It's very much along the lines of some new herbal dietary shake - it can advertise itself as it likes, the FDA still won't approve it or take its unbelievable claims as legitimate.<br /><br />But that doesn't matter to the author, he's already told you this from the beginning. This is a person who out-sources his book ideas to other writers, pays them for their labor and puts his name on the book.  In fact, the first few chapters covers the fact that the author is only in this for the prestige and financial gain of writing hasty books on popular subjects, even if he knows absolutely nothing about them or tried it himself.  It's a con job, and openly admitted.<br /><br />Therefore, this book is not a self-help for writers, it doesn't teach you how to organize your writing work and it definitely does not help you achieve 2k words per hour.  It's a long soliloquy, often redundant, on how a procrastinator managed to write a book himself for a change, and because relying on other people todo his work for him fell through, he pushed himself like crazy to meet a deadline.  That is all it is.<br /><br />Now, the only part I found slightly informative is how to trick Amazon into listing you as a bestselling author (another con, in a way) even if your book is crud.  It has nothing to do with your book, its subject or quality, it's about trickery.  And makes sense, because every other author I meet who market on amazon is a &#34;bestselling writer,&#34; even if they can barely sell their book after its initial release.<br /><br />Save your money.  There really is nothing being taught here beyond conning your way through the writing industry, writing about topics you know nothing about just to bank on popular trends, and making promises which do not deliver.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'For anyone who has any interest in technology, this will be a great investment. I\\'ve only begun to dig in and already the stories are interesting - stories from an era before my time! The book is organized by decade. The stories are varied and quite fascinating, most of them also amusing or just plain hilarious. I look forward to reading more of it.<br /><br />If you are a nerd or really into computers, this is a must. It will help you to understand and better appreciate the technology that today is taken quite for granted, simply because it\\'s no longer impressive compared to what\\'s out there now on the cutting edge, and because today\\'s younger generations grew up with it. But think on this: any search website provides you with search results for the ENTIRE INTERNET in less than a second. Every second of every day, people travel through the air all over the entire world. Satellites communicate tirelessly with almost anything and provide us most of the everyday pleasures which we also take for granted - streaming video, online games, and phone service, just to name a few. Video conferencing is common and affordable, allowing you to talk to loved ones face-to-face from the other side of the world. Phones can now function as your media player, personal planner, and portable gaming system all in one. Many phones and other small devices today are orders of magnitude more powerful than the first mainframe computers, which took up an entire room of a building.<br /><br />If any of this got you thinking or even curious about technology, give this book a read. You don\\'t need to be a \"hacker\" to understand it. Most of the articles are written for (and sometimes, by) people who are not themselves hackers.<br /><br />Overall, a great value and great stories contained within.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Raymond Smullyan is a master of blending wondrous tales of adventure seamlessly with complex topics such as functional, abstract, and symbolic logic, as well as deductive games and exercises. This book is actually one of the best explorations of combinatory logic I have ever encountered. Disguised cleverly by the analogy of birds singing, you will be working through complex mathematical proofs in no time, without even realizing that you're doing it! You'll think it's all just bluebirds and warblers calling to each other!<br /><br />Combinatory logic is one of the most obscure and fascinating branches of logic I have ever encountered. Its mathematical counterpart (largely the same thing) is known as lambda calculus, and it in fact is used extensively in artificial intelligence and programming language design. The Lisp programming language is actually based on lambda calculus. Learning either combinatory logic or lambda calculus is a venture for only those whose mind is best suited to mathematics, logic, or computer science. If you are someone interested in all three (like myself) then this is the book for you!<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for nerdy types, or anyone who likes puzzles.\",\n",

When 2 detectives are on the case and investigating the murder of their latest victim, one of them notices how much Susan looks like the others... hunky detective Michael gets the urge to protect Susan.

The first one is about Raena who lives under water and is treated so badly by her master, Orlish. It is her job as a special seamstress to her master and when one of her suits causes a tragedy, she is punished. The second one is about a haunted house that is abandoned after the family is tragically slain there. When Grace is asked out by the school hottie, Brandon, she just can't say no to him. Even when he suggests that they double date with his friend Greg and his girlfriend Elizabeth and want to visit the house, Grace has this feeling in her gut that they shouldn't go,but doesn't want Brandon to think she's afraid so they meet the other couple there. After they walk into the house,Grace is sure she should have followed her instincts to save her from the horror in the house !!! This is the nightmare one lol. The last one is more like a mystery when people end up missing in a small town, and then later found dead with no clues to who the murderer is. The local police calls in a professional profiler to help with the case. When the FBI, joins in on the investigation, they doubt her ability to be able to help because she is blind. This story had a surprise that I didn't expect. I recommend this book for scary quick reading.\",\n",

In this book, she even meets death himself ! To me he sounds like an interesting character, but Deanna wants to know why is he following her? After her brother has died, he hasn't &#34;moved on&#34; and gran is beginning to worry and wonder why he hasn't been around. Although Deanna knows there is a waiting period, she thought he would have showed up at her house by now...could death stalking her have anything to do with it? I really liked the bar that she must go into after she agrees to Ivy setting her up on a ghost hunting show. A great and mysterious ghost story once again..!\",\n",

While in the months that she is deciding,she is also too busy to keep practicing witchcraft,so it ends up fading...a lot.,the stones and crystals are turning to dust and the ink on the pages of her special books of spells is disappearing. David,her warder tells her she must use her powers to make them strong and come back to her...so she creates an anime to help her clean and restore her magical tools....but while she is performing her creative spell,she is distracted by the memory of her passionate night with David...and unknowingly creates a monster,...no problem there right? ,Lol until the anime runs away and can not be found.....the adventure in the book really picks up then..and the reason I think this is the best book so far is because of what happens after she finds out that the anime is missing...Jane truely comes into her own after the anime captures Neko,her familiar.!!

Mara is struggling to make a living and pay her rent and after she gets evicted from her apartment, she tries a magic spell,knowing that even if it does work,she might have terrible consequences to deal with later.  Well the spell works and she soon receives a letter telling her that  her aunt Tillie is dead and that she has left Mara her cottage in wisconsin,she has this reoccurring dream about a woman crashing her car,dying,and a road in the woods. After she travels by car to the new town she stops at the local gas station/ mini Mart for supplies and the young clerk warns her that her new cottage is haunted. She laughs it off and continues to the cottage. Suddenly she has a de ja vue moment and recognizes the area, and its the same one in her dreams !! To make matters worse,she thinks it was her aunt in the dreams and she caused the accident that killed her.  Mara  ends up living there and discovers the portal to hell and she releases 2  demons from the past. Then her aunt Tillies ghost  teams up with her and soon ,her gay friend Gus comes to help them.

There she meets Hunter and of course falls in love. There is a lot that happens between that but I had problems with the overall plot.<br />Pros: The book had very few grammatical errors and therefore was nicely written. I liked the premise of the story and although the cover art did not depict the nature of the book, I had no complaints there.<br />Cons: The shortening of her name to 'X' was annoying. Couldn't get on board with that one. The end of the book was rushed and more of a wrap up that should have been an epilogue. Hunter who was from the past moved to the future and his acclimation to the future was glossed over. I mean, If I find out the woman that I have feelings for is somehow NOW an immortal witch when she pulls out her wand and saves me, wouldn't it shock me? And vice versa... that left me a tiny bit puzzled that more explanation wasn't given. Both characters are immortal and will have a happily ever after, can I get their feelings in a conversation rather than a paragraph.<br />The entire book dragged on nonsensically. Yes, I liked the suspense and action but I could have done without the entire passage dedicated to Napoleon and maybe more thought put in to completing what should have been a phenomenal ending.

       "  'title': '‘Mooncakes & Milk Bread’: A warm, floury hug of nostalgia for Chinese bakeries',\n",
       "  'text': 'San Francisco-based Kristina Cho, writer of the blog Eat Cho Food, dedicates her first cookbook, “Mooncakes & Milk Bread,” to the Chinese bakeries and cafes of her childhood in Cleveland, Ohio. Presented with an ample dose of nostalgia, the book provides foolproof recipes for such staples as egg tarts, scallion pancakes, steamed barbecue pork buns and milk tea.<br /><br />“Mooncakes & Milk Bread” is the first English cookbook to exclusively focus on Chinese bakeries, but many of the recipes, from shokupan and melonpan to Swiss roll cakes and mille crepe cakes, will be familiar to readers in Japan.<br /><br />Growing up in her family’s Chinese restaurant, with parents and grandparents hailing from Hong Kong, some of Cho’s favorite childhood memories involve trips to her local bakery as well as visiting Chinatown shops outside of Cleveland. Chinese bakeries first gained popularity in Hong Kong, with its unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures. Since ovens were typically a rare feature in Chinese homes, buying pastries from a bakery was a special treat.<br /><br />Many of the recipes, such as the bo lo bao (pineapple buns) and gai mei bao (cocktail buns), hold a special place in Cho’s heart.<br /><br />“They are two of the most iconic Chinese bakery buns and I couldn’t write a book about Chinese bakeries without them,” she says. “My Goong Goong’s (Grandpa’s) and Pau Pau’s (Grandma’s) recipes are incredibly special to me, and I’m so glad that a few of their recipes made it into the book. Goong Goong’s almond cookies, Pau Pau’s fa gao (steamed prosperity cakes) and her white pizza are some of my favorite recipes in the book.”<br /><br />For those new to baking, Cho recommends starting with the book’s “mother of all milk bread” recipe. Milk bread, better known as shokupan in Japan, is an enriched dough that uses tangzhong (a heated roux of flour and milk) to pregelatinize the starch, which results in a more moist, fluffier loaf that stays fresh longer.<br /><br />“Once you feel comfortable with that dough, you unlock so many more fun recipes,” Cho says.<br /><br />Using milk bread as the base recipe, you’ll find myriad sweet and savory ways to use it, from sambal and parmesan buns to hot dog flower buns and rhubarb tarts. The diagrams showing how to cut and shape each of the specialty buns are particularly enjoyable, and the step-by-step photos were enormously helpful for learning new techniques. The recipes also conveniently include both metric and imperial measurements.<br /><br />For those looking for traditional Chinese breakfast foods, the book includes staples such as Hong Kong bubble waffles, steamed buns and dumplings. There are also instructions on how to pack your own bakery box or the ultimate steamer basket, and how to whip up flavored milk teas from the comfort of your home.<br /><br />“Mooncakes & Milk Bread” is the cookbook equivalent of a warm, floury hug; its 80-plus recipes transcend generations and geography and make Chinese baking accessible for everyone.',\n",

Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange, Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala, Spaghetti with Ricotta, Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone, and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil, Marjoram, and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.<br /><br />Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere, German beef, beet and potato stew, and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple, provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.<br /><br />The salads are a particular delight, including the rainbow potato salad with radishes, shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs, beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate, raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino, and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.<br /><br />Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine, like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar, watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala, basil and mint, and squash pasta with orange, maple and sage.<br /><br />If you are someone who, like me, can never seem to come up with a complete menu, that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.<br /><br />I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes; slow roasted and tossed with olive oil, confectioner’s sugar, and herbs, they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!<br /><br />Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.<br /><br />This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years; highly recommended.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Usually I\\'m a bit suspicious of any book that claims desserts with quick prep times, expecting them to rely heavily on packaged and chemical-laden shortcuts.<br /><br />So I was very pleasantly surprised by \"The Weeknight Dessert Cookbook\" by Mary Younkin.<br /><br />Containing 80 recipes for puddings, refrigerator pies, bars, cookies, and cakes, you\\'ll find a diverse collection of classics like pound cake and chocolate chip cookies mixed in with treats like black forest bars, chocolate blueberry brownies, cranberry lemon scone cookies, and chocolate caramel pecan pound cake.<br /><br />There are no boxed mixes here, everything is whipped up from scratch (note that the 5-15 minutes refers only to the prep; the baking still takes normal time).<br /><br />As a single household, I also loved that many of the cakes and desserts are geared towards 1-5 servings in many cases, meaning no need to halve the recipe or have too many leftovers (most of these treats freeze well if so).<br /><br />Measurements / temperatures are given in US as well as metric.<br /><br />I look forward to purchasing Ms. Younkin\\'s \"Weeknight Dinners\" and \"Weekday Lunches and Breakfasts\" on the strength of this title; if you enjoy baking but are in a crunch for time, this will become your new best friend to get delicious desserts on the table that the whole family will enjoy!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Having lived in Japan for four years, Japanese food (specifically homestyle cuisine) is a topic near and dear to my heart, so I was thrilled when my friend Atsuko Ikeda released “Atsuko’s Japanese Kitchen,” which contains the wisdom over more than 10 years of her cooking classes.<br /><br />In a country as ancient as Japan, tradition and ceremony plays a huge role in everyday life, influencing every aspect. Nowhere is this truer than in the kitchen. Many of the principles of Japanese cuisine (five colors, flavors and cooking methods, best known for its role in Zen shojin ryori) date back hundreds of years (if not longer).<br /><br />Beginning with a very helpful overview of the eight major regions of Japan (each one with its own regional specialties), the introduction (particularly the graphic organizers / sample meal planners and cooking timelines) alone is worth the cost of the book.<br /><br />The very helpful illustrated guide to pantry essentials and kitchen tools will help you to track down exactly the right items to make your Japanese meals a success. You’ll also learn to craft dashi (Japan’s “mother sauce”), how to cook the perfect rice, and how to pair sake.<br /><br />The “small dishes for sharing” include staples like nasu dengaku, dashimaki tamago, wasabi edamame, deep-fried skewers, fried tofu, karaage, and gyoza along with fusion items like mushrooms with blue cheese, yuzu ponzu and truffle.<br /><br />Miso soup is a must in Japan (it’s consumed at nearly every meal). I absolutely loved the variations like miso soup with watercrewss and fried tofu and aubergine and sesame miso soup to add a little variety to my regular routine.<br /><br />And noodle-based soups like ramen and udon are ubiquitous in Japan; I greatly appreciated that Atsuko provided some vegetarian alternatives like Piri Kara Soba, Tonyu Kinoko Jiru, and an eggplant mapo tofu (I was surprised to learn that we share the same shojin ryori mentor Mari Fujii-san!).<br /><br />You’ll find regional specialties like Miyazaki’s Chicken Nanban and comforting family meals like shabu shabu, tuna tataki, nabe (hotpot), braised pork belly, and traditional sides like green beans dressed with toasted sesame seeds and pumpkin salad.<br /><br />Although many of the dishes are meat and seafood-based, there are several excellent sides for pickled, marinated and dressed veggies and a number of tofu-based dishes (including a savory shio-koji marinated tofu cutlet).<br /><br />Desserts include Dorayaki, ichigo daifuku, baked tofu cheesecake, an amazing matcha tiramisu, yuzu rare cheesecake, and a vegan almond kuzu tofu,<br /><br />The food photography by Yuki Sugiura is uniformly outstanding, with beautiful Japanese ceramics and tablewares showing off ingredients and dishes to their best advantage (in Japan, we eat with our eyes first…)<br /><br />So if you’ve wanted to learn to cook Japanese food at home but thought it was too daunting, this wonderful cookbook will guide you step by step and give you the confidence to soon be cooking dishes that would be at home on any dinner table in Japan.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I am fairly new to the Instant Pot realm, but quickly embraced the many authorized IP cookbooks that have flooded the market in recent years (I have a particular fondness for international cuisine in the IP).<br /><br />So when I saw the Instant Pot Sous Vide cookbook, I jumped on it....I have read about (but never cooked with) a sous vide circulator and was looking forward to seeing how this cooking method would work with the Instant Pot... in short, it doesn\\'t.<br /><br />Although \"Instant Pot\" is in the title, what the book is actually marketing is the Instant Pot SSV800 Accu Slim Sous Vide Immersion Circulator, 6 or 8 quart.  WIthout it, the cookbook is not usable. The other issue with cooking sous vide is that it requires special bags (yes, you can use freezer bags in place of the more expensive sous vide bags, but the book has a curious note about not cooking in plastic due to chemicals leaching into the food...which I find a bit puzzling for a book on sous vide.) You can use the Instant Pot sous vide circulator with the Instant Pot insert or any stockpot.<br /><br />The principal behind sous vide cooking is circulating hot water over vacuum-sealed food, which produces incredibly tender meats that are finished by pan searing.<br /><br />The author does a good job of explaining the basics of sous vide cooking, common temperatures, and pros and cons of the method, but if you do not already own a sous vide circulator, the book has little appeal.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the bulk of the recipes are meat-based, including beef and lamb, pork, poultry and eggs, fish and shellfish, fruits and vegetables, grains, custards and sauces, and infusions.<br /><br />The novelty of the sous vide method seems overused at times; poaching eggs requires 60 minutes in a sous vide bath, versus mere minutes on the stove. The same can be said for recipes that have you sous vide ingredients only to stir fry other components separately; it would be much faster to simply prepare everything on the stovetop.<br /><br />One fairly important disclosure is that the photos used are largely stock photos, which always makes me wonder if the recipes were in fact beta-tested by reviewers.<br /><br />Who this book is for: If you already own a sous vide circulator, this may be of interest, but for those who only own the Instant Pot, this will do you little good without purchasing additional equipment (and like the author, I am not a fan of cooking in plastic; even if I owned a sous vide circulator, it is not a piece of equipment that would see regular use).',\n",

       "  'text': 'In 2011, my family and I spent three glorious weeks exploring the coastline, landscapes and cuisine of Northern Italy in the Piedmont, Liguria (including the fabled Cinque Terre), the honeyed sunsets of Tuscany, and magical Venice. From tasting Chianti in its hometown to slow food in Siena and browsing the market stalls of Florence, my trip left an indelible impression on me after years of only reading about Italy, and the cuisine was a world away from “Italian” cuisine I’d experienced living in the United States, Canada, Spain and Japan.<br /><br />When I was offered the chance to review Gennaro Contaldo’s “Passione,” I snapped it up. I previously reviewed Gennaro  “Italian Bakery”; a fixture in Jamie Oliver’s restaurants and Jamie’s mentor, his down-to-earth recipes capture the pleasures of life in the Italian countryside and are straightforward and unfussy – no complicated lists of hard-to-source ingredients, only pantry staples and seasonal produce (including fresh fava beans, basil, jewel-like strawberries and sun-ripened tomatoes).<br /><br />Featuring photographs from Gennaro’s childhood on the Amalfi coast,, readers are also taken on a journey around Italy, with more than 100 recipes and formative stories of foraging for mushrooms, free-diving for oysters, and skipping school to go fishing llustrating his “free range” childhood that later influenced his cooking style (his restaurant Passione in Charlotte Street, London, was awarded Best Italian restaurant in 2005 and he more recently hosted his own TV series, Two Greedy Italians on PBS).<br /><br />The included recipes in “Passione” are much lighter than what I normally think of as “Italian food,” my perception no doubt colored by Italian-American restaurants. The dishes are simple, fresh, and balanced, perfect for dining al fresco. You’ll find favorites like bruschetta, arancini, genuine Neopolitan pizza, focaccia with garlic and rosemary, and risottos alongside tagliatelle with fresh tuna, lemon and arugula, grilled lamb chops filled with prosciutto and herbs, orange and fennel salad, and a Neopolitan Easter wheat and ricotta tart.<br /><br />The iconic flavors of southern Italy will transport you to a land of sunshine and lemons, seafood still glistening with droplets of salt water and tomatoes still warm from the sun. As a vegetarian, I loved unusual mains like eggplant slices with a Parmesan and polenta crust, stuffed artichokes and zucchini, various handmade gnocchis, carpaccio of smoke mozzarella cheese, stuffed fava bean cakes, and fresh, light vegetable salads and grilled vegetables. Desserts include semifreddo, lemon tart, and chocolate and red wine cake.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful addition to your cookbook library that is perfect for any occasion – the short, accessible ingredient lists and straightforward preparations are doable by any level of home cook, and Gennaro offers a wealth of ways to incorporate a wealth of seasonal produce.',\n",

       "  'text': 'For the last 13 years, I have been blessed to teach students from over 100 countries, including many Georgian students… I quickly fell in love with their sense of humor, language, and most of all, their culture, dance, wine and cuisine. My students and I had many discussions about the merits of various types of khachapuri, khinkali, and Georgian supras, feasts with a range of cold dishes liked stuffed vegetables, dips and cheeses, hot stews, vegetable dishes, dumplings, barbequed and grilled meats, and you’ll find all of these dishes and more tucked between the pages. Georgian hospitality is legendary, and Georgian tamadas, or toastmasters, take toasting duties seriously; the toasts go on for hours well into the next day.<br /><br />Nestled between the Caucasus Mountains and the Black Sea, Georgia’s cuisine is unsurprisingly influenced by its geographic neighbors (Russia to the north and Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to the south), the rolling hills and fertile valleys birthing a cuisine that is at once exotic and familiar at the same time.<br /><br />Carla Capalbo’s Tasting Georgia focuses on Georgia’s ancient winemaking tradition using qvevri, large terracotta vessels that are sealed with beeswax. If cared for, a qvevri can last for decades or even centuries. The book begins, most appropriately, with one of Georgia’s most iconic recipes that is also finding newfound fame in the United States: khachapuri, cheese-filled breads. There are regional variations around Georgia including versions with potatoes and hard-boiled eggs. There are also numerous pages devoted to khinkali, handheld stuffed dumplings said to have arrived with the Mongol invasion that can include goose, meat, potato, cheese, soup dumplings, and other variations.<br /><br />Several seasonings are unique to Georgian cuisine, including marigold, jonjoli, and tkemali (plum-based sour sauces). Coriander and blue fenugreek are also frequently used. Like Persian cuisine, there is liberal use of pomegranates (and plum sauce) to add a sour element to dishes. Crushed walnuts and walnut sauce are frequently used to dress vegetable and meat dishes.<br /><br />Divided by region, you’ll find mouthwatering food photography interspersed with scenes of markets, farms, and everyday life. The included dishes are unfussy and feel delightfully homestyle; vegetarians will rejoice as there are many vegetable-forward recipes in Georgian cuisine, such as eggs with green beans, leeks with walnut paste, eggplant rolls stuffed with walnut paste, pumpkin with walnuts, tarragon and egg pie, bread stuffed with beet greens, etc. Recipes feature the name in English and Georgian as well as US and metric ingredients, which I appreciate as I prefer to cook by weight rather than volume (particularly for baking).<br /><br />In addition to in-depth discussions of winemaking and profiles of local vintners, chefs, and home cooks, Carla has also included detailed travel tips on local markets, restaurants, cafes, etc. that make this a great travel companion as well. A recipe and meal planner and bibliography and travel information are also provided.<br /><br />Carla has renewed my interest in visiting the beautiful, inviting country of Georgia, and I am happy to finally be able to recreate the recipes that my visiting students longingly described in great detail. I hope one day to be able to visit in person, but in the meanwhile, I’ll be in the kitchen paying tribute to the rich cuisine of Georgia with a glass of Georgian wine in hand - გაგიმარჯოთ!',\n",

       "  'text': 'I’ve been blessed to teach hundreds of students from the Middle East, who generously shared their culture, cuisine and stories over tiny porcelain cups of cardamom-scented Arabic coffee, dates from royal orchards, and rosewater-soaked pastries, and “Baladi” captures the essence of Palestine in a beautifully tangible way that pays tributes to Palestine’s farmers, fishermen, bakers, market sellers, and ordinary daily family life – you will certainly want to add this to your cookbook collection and it is one of my top cookbooks of 2018.<br /><br />I previously reviewed Joudie Kalla’s love song “Palestine on a Plate” in January 2017 when I quickly fell in love with the brilliant recipes and remembrances of her family’s kitchen. In her sophomore “Baladi: Palestine: A Celebration of Food from Land and Sea,” Joudie again pays homage to her homeland of Palestine, this time by taking readers to small villages, farms, orchards, markets and experiencing the changing seasons and various cuisines.<br /><br />The word “Baladi” means “My home, my land, my country.” Despite its small size, Palestine is home to a wide range of terrains, including uninhabited desert and cold areas along the northern border, with access to the sea and rivers as well as an abundance of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs. Because of its prime location on a trade route crossing multiple borders, there are also other international influences on Palestinian cuisine which “makes us all family in the end.”<br /><br />Market life is central to traditional Palestinian culture and dictates the day’s menu, as many still shop daily and buy whatever is freshest. In the market chapter, you’ll find turmeric mlik with cracked cardamom pods, Arabic coffee, the incredibly simple yet indulgent grape molasses and tahini spread (the Palestinian equivalent to the PB&J of our youth!), the fantastic fryup of grilled halloumi, fried eggs, and roasted tomatoes, mixed vegetable salad with tahini dressing, soft-boiled eggs with yogurt, chili and lemon, fried eggplant slices with honey and tahini, watermelon, feta and red onion with mint, and hummus (the entire first chapter is basically a vegetarian’s dream menu).<br /><br />“The Fields and Earth” offers up an abundant harvest of veggies served every way: fried okra with chili, roasted beets,  sautéed, caramelized (the caramelized shallots with herby labneh was a revelation!), served kubbeh-style, fresh salads (goat cheese, dates, and endives pair spectacularly), and lemon potatoes.<br /><br />s a baker at heart, my heart sang at the wide range of stuffed pastries and homemade breads like khubez (pita), Mai’s Akkawi Bread liberally coated in za’atar and stuffed with salty white cheese, za’atar and feta brioche twists, fatayer, and dumplings.<br /><br />“The farm” delights meat eaters with ample recipes for lamb and poultry, while the seas and rivers offer arak-poached salmon, marinated sardines, shatta-marinated sea bass with crushed rose petals, fish skewers, fried fish, and kataifi-wrapped shrimp.<br /><br />“Hills and orchards” uses the abundance of the harvest to create watermelon juice with mint and orange blossom (I got hooked on fresh watermelon juice living in Taiwan, and there is no better cure for summer heat and humidity), fresh pomegranate and mango juice, strawberry, orange blossom, and rose jam, apple and pistachio jam, preserved lemons, pickled olives, baklawa, filo pastries filled with sweetened cream, rose and pistachio eclairs, the endangered tamriyeh, khafeh cheesecake, pistachio, zucchini, and lemon cake, black sesame cake, chocolate and labneh cake with slivered pistachios, qatayef, tahini halva, and gorgeous, dramatic ice cream roulades.<br /><br />Recipe names are given in English and Arabic in both metric and US measurements.<br /><br />The book is illustrated throughout with luscious food photography by Jamie Orlando Smith, stunning photography of Palestine’s diverse landscapes as well as scenes from daily life (working the farm, pulling noodles, carrying in the day’s catch), gorgeous table settings, and Palestinian embroidery. Each recipe offers the reader / cook insight into ingredients, preparation, or personal memories that make these more than simple recipes;  instead you feel as if you are sharing a meal with Joudie’s family.<br /><br />(review copy courtesy of Interlink Books – shukran!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'As the grandchildren of immigrants as well as a second-generation American, “The Immigrant Cookbook: Recipes that Make America Great” speaks to me on a very personal level. My grandmother and great-grandparents immigrated from southeast Poland in the early 20th century and my grandmother would frequently recall the steerage class ocean crossing on the SS Lapland as well as take out her copy of the Ellis Island Cookbook. No slouch in the kitchen, she recreated the flavors of her homeland, at times using New World substitutions or would have friends bring staples like kielbasa and farmers cheese from distant Chicago. Luckily their new community had a large, vibrant Polish community (which has sadly diminished with the passing of the older generation) and I was raised to appreciate the Polish language, songs, culture, and most of all, cuisine.<br /><br />America has and will always be a nation of immigrants; this includes the Cajuns of Louisiana, Mexican-American and Tex-Mex communities, the vibrant Polish communities of Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee, Dearborn’s Arab enclave, and the many Greektowns and Chinatowns. “The Immigrant Cookbook: Recipes that Make America Great” is the panacea to the current atmosphere of anti-immigrant rhetoric and reminds us of the richness that these many new Americans have contributed to our collective cuisine. In addition to being the grandchild of immigrants, I have also been honored to teach students from over 100 countries, including war-torn ones like Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia, and South Sudan, and I treasure my discussions about food and culture with my students (some of them even cooked for me!).<br /><br />Divided thematically into nine chapters, Leyla Moushabeck has collected 75 recipes that pay tribute to the richness of the immigrant experience. From crispy pork belly, smoky eggplant dips, coconut-infused “dream fish” and the smoky spice of chipotle-lime chicken to desserts rich with syrup and rosewater and the showstopping fruit pavlova crowned with mango, pineapple, sand passion fruit, there are recipes that will appeal to everyone.<br /><br />You’ll find such notable names as Daniel Boulud (Lyonnaise Salad with Lardons), Jose Andres (Tichi’s Gazpacho), Joanne Chang (Mama Chang’s Hot and Sour Soup), Salma Hage (Vegan Lebanese Moussaka), Najmieh Batmanglij (Pomegranate and Walnut Khoresh), Ana Sortun, Martin Yang (Steamed Fish with Ginger Wine Sauce), Aaron Sanchez (Carnitas Tacos), Curtis Stone (Pavlova with Coconut Cream and Tropical Fruit), Einat Admony (Fenugreek Fried Bread), Dominique Ansel (Mini Madelines), and Joan Nathan (German Plum Tart) alongside up-and-coming young chefs showcasing recipes proudly representing their homelands. I loved that there is an alphabetical list of contributors including detailed biographies (and bibliographies). Some of the recipes are already a mixture of immigrant influences, such as Peru’s Japanese-infused cuisine, or Israel’s rich melting pot.<br /><br />Many of the included recipes are homestyle dishes that can be put together fairly quickly; I particularly loved the salads like Kurus with Spoon Salad, Reem’s Muhammara, Smoky Eggplant Dip with Pomegranates and Walnuts and the Gazan Hot Tomato and Dill Salad, which I like to serve as a meal as a spread of several hot and cold vegetable salads accompanied by homemade naan and fresh fruit. Others like Sicilian Frittedda embrace seasonal veggies like artichokes, fresh fava beans (which are currently in season here in Japan) and asparagus with a surprising whisper of mint that brightens the vegetal notes.<br /><br />Measurements are given in both US and metric, which I appreciated.<br /><br />Interlink Books (the same publishing company behind the bestselling fundraiser “Soup for Syria”) has produced another beautiful, welcoming book that is certain to inspire you to expand your own culinary repertoire (in addition to cooking my family’s Polish cuisine, I am also well-versed on Japanese, Turkish, and Middle Eastern / Persian cooking). It’s also commendable that Interlink publishing will donate a minimum of $5 from the sale of each book to the American Civil Liberties Union to support the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. Please join me in supporting this worthwhile cause by purchasing this great book!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Murray Thom and Tim Harper collect sixty talented New Zealand bakers’ takes on classic bakes, from tarts, roulades, pavlovas, croissants and laminated dough to innovative unrefined / raw desserts, savouries (asparagus, mint and feta bread, scones, spanakopita, quiches, leek and cheese tarts, fritters), biscuits and confections. You’ll find standards like Chelsea buns, roly-poly pudding, slices, Anzac biscuits, lamingtons, and puddings enhanced with tropical touches like mango, tamarillo, kiwi and passionfruit as well as plenty of vegetarian, raw and gluten-free offerings. There is truly something to appeal to everyone (they also published “The New Zealand Birthday Cake Book; see review below)! Many classic French / European bakes like clafoutis, frangipane, Florentines, speculoos, etc. are presented in a straightforward, easy to follow format that even novice bakers will find success with. In addition to bakes, you’ll also find classic confections like honeycomb, sea salt caramel lollipops, homemade marshmallows, mousse, panforte, salted almond black sesame brittle.<br /><br />The savoury bakes make great offerings for relaxed brunches or even lunches; I loved the unusual combination of the asparagus, mint and feta bread and used some extraordinarily fine asparagus as the crowning touch. Savoury brioche, leek and cheese tarts and flaky spanakopita are joined by frittata, pasties, and even the ultimate comfort food spaghetti and cheese toasts. I found myself relying on these for quick weeknight dinners, and even ended up repurposing some (the frittata and asparagus, mint and feta bread) as workday lunches that traveled well.<br /><br />As a vegetarian who enjoys healthier, lighter treats, I was intrigued by some of the book’s raw offerings like fruit and nut raw chocolate, chocolate, orange, and fig buckwheat bars, and hazelnut and apricot fruit and nut bars. I grew up in a Polish household where kasha (buckwheat) was a staple side dish, but had never tried to use it in a dessert, let alone raw. Here in Japan, buckwheat flour is most commonly used as soba noodles, although there are buckwheat flour cookies in Japan. Finding actual raw buckwheat groats was a bit more challenging, but I found I loved the combination of the crunchy raw buckwheat (you soak it overnight, which lends it a crumbly texture), figs, sea salt and orange zest; these make great on-the-go treats or snacks. The raw raspberry brownies use a combination of Brazil nuts, dates, avocados, coco powder, and freeze-dried raspberries to impart the sort of lovely dense fudginess that people expect from a good brownie, without the added cholesterol, refined sugar, or guilt!<br /><br />The book offers numerous tips, a handy hand drawn cook’s companion with “close-enough” conversions, and I particularly loved the fact that the index also included a detailed listing of various types of baked goods, clearly marked recipes for dairy-free and gluten-free, and the vegetarian offerings even labeled which ingredients were not vegetarian (gelatin, marshmallows, etc. ).

       "  'text': 'Food blogger and home cook Maryam Sinaiee takes readers through a full year in the Persian kitchen, including the festivals, traditions and rituals that make up day-to-day life across Iran.<br /><br />Born in Tehran, Maryam learned to cook from her mother, grandmothers, and aunts. The kitchens of her youth were filled with the aromas of frying kotlet, stained glass jars of pickled fruits and vegetables, and sweets.  After relocating to the UK, she started her blog the Persian Fusion.<br /><br />Iran is a large country, with many regional specialties. What we call Persian cuisine has been shaped by the Persian Empire’s ancient expansion, trade on the Silk Road, and the wide range of climates within Iran. Regional cooking in southern Iran has been influenced by Indian, Arab and African cuisines. The recipes in the book are taken from Gilan, Mazandaran, Azarbaijan, Kurdistan, Hormozgan, and Khuzestan.<br /><br />Persian food is based on the theory of “hot” and “cold”: high-energy, high-protein foods are considered “hot” (no relation to spicy), while many vegetables and fruit (particularly sour ones) are “cold.” Persian meals are a careful balance of these elements; it’s believed that too much “hot” food can cause rashes and hot flashes, while too much “cold” food causes digestive issues and low energy. A meal may balance out each of these elements in the same dish; for example, walnuts are “hot” so they are served with pomegranate (“cold.”).<br /><br />Like my country of Japan, Persian cuisine places great importance on seasonality and the first vegetables of the season, which are called “first of the harvest.” The Persian calendar is based around nature, beginning in March with Noruz (the spring equinox). Iran’s seasonal festivals (including harvest and rain) predate Islam by some 1,400 years. Persian cuisine places high priority on hospitality, and above all, beautiful presentation; dishes are garnished with saffron, yogurt, nuts, caramelized onions or herbs.<br /><br />Beginning with spring, many seasonal fruits and veggies are incorporated, including rhubarb, onion and egg soup, lamb and rhubarb stew, fava bean and dill frittata, and rice with fava beans and dill (thankfully fresh fava beans, or “soramame,” are also a springtime staple here in Japan!). Summer finds lighter dishes using apricots, plums, cherries and mulberries, as well as chilled soups and cold salads, from the refreshing chilled yogurt and cucumber soup, rice with sour cherries, smoky eggplant dip, and zucchini with garlic, yogurt, and toasted rose petals to refreshing rosewater ice cream with pistachios and a melon and rosewater smoothie. Autumn is the season for quince, squash, pomegranates, pistachios and barberries. Heartier stews and dishes like duck in walnut sauce, lamb and dried plum steew, herbed meatballs and polos (pilavs) are rounded out with stuffed quinces, and butternut squash pancakes. Chilly winter features dried legumes, dried fruits, nuts and wheat noodles, like noodle soups, stews, hotpots, and hearty polos. The “Basics” chapter provides recipes for important elements like steamed rice, breads (taftun, barbari), salads, pickles, garnishes, and drinks.<br /><br />The food photography (styled and shot by Maryam) is absolutely stunning, with beautifully plated and arranged dishes in an explosion of color and textures. The edges of the pages feature brilliant ceramic tiles and geometric designs, while black and white family photos and scenes from everyday life give a personal touch to the beautiful food photography. Recipes include both metric and US measurements, which I greatly appreciated as I prefer to cook by weight rather than volume, particularly when baking. There is also a glossary of Persian cooking terms.<br /><br />I own numerous Persian cookbooks, and “From the Land of Nightingales and Roses” has quickly become one of my favorites due to the wide range of regional recipes, ease of finding most ingredients (I keep a fairly well stocked Persian pantry of barberries, spices, dried limes and dried herbs on hand), cultural tidbits, and beautiful photography – it is also highly accessible for vegetarians as many of the vegetable and rice dishes are vegetarian or can easily be made so. The flavor combinations are outstanding too: I loved the inclusion of currants and dates in the rice and green lentils with brown butter eggs, or the saffron potato frittata, which combines mashed potatoes, walnuts, cinnamon, and rose petals in a beautifully layered dish that also holds up well for leftovers (it reminded me of the Spanish potato omelette I used to eat as an exchange student in Spain).<br /><br />Fans of Yotam Ottolenghi, Persian, and Middle Eastern cuisine will want to add this to your collection as soon as possible – it’s as close as you can get to a food tour of Iran (which is probably outside the realm of possibility for many readers).',\n",

       "  'text': 'I own dozens of vegetarian and vegan cookbooks and love to track down unusual ones (especially with an international theme), so I was excited to be offered \"Feasts of Veg\" by Nina Olsson, a Swedish designer and blogger.<br /><br />\"Feasts of Veg\" is centered around the idea of food for celebrations; there are various themed menus for summer and winter gatherings, celebration salads, appetizers, picnic menus and desserts.<br /><br />I have been a cookbook reviewer and vegetarian for 15 years, so I\\'ve read and cooked from multitudes of vegetarian and vegan offerings from the UK and Europe. I also run a Japanese cooking group on Facebook and specialize in Japanese vegetarian temple cuisine, so I was surprised to see many Japanese-inspired dishes like okonomiyaki, onigiri, furikake popcorn, tofu dengaku, miso-glazed eggplant with furikake rice, etc. included.<br /><br />I love some of the ideas like hot eggplant chips, broccoli soup and feta cream, and the labneh and harissa-roasted carrots (very similar to a recipe by Ottolenghi that I make often) and many of these recipes have been trending over the last couple of years (celeriac \"steak\", cauliflower steaks, barbecued jackfruit).<br /><br />Perhaps it is my overly fussy taste buds, but things like the layered savory cake (egg salad and tofu terrine frosted with mascarpone) or the creen crepe cake with homemade chocolate spread and chia jam are not things that appeal to me (and have a fairly lengthy list of steps).  The book is beautifully photographed and presented and will appeal to fans of Anna Jones or the Green Table, but if you are not familiar / comfortable with unfamiliar international flavors or lengthy lists of ingredients (which may not be easy for everyone to purchase, especially if you live in a rural area), \"Feasts of Veg\" may end up being more of a coffee table volume.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I’m so happy to share my friend Rinku Battacharya’s new book “Instant Indian”; it features 100 authentic recipes from around India, including dals, idli, curries, chaat, biryani, pulao, and more! There are also recipes for paneer, no-knead naan, yogurt, and spice blends.<br /><br />I previously reviewed Rinku’s excellent “Spices and Seasons”; in recent months, I’ve jumped on the Instant Pot bandwagon and have found myself purchasing several Indian and international cookbooks designed specifically for the Instant Pot. Previously, I would avoid cooking dishes with dry beans due to the long soaking and cooking time required, but the Instant Pot handles most types of dried beans in 25 minutes or less, making it perfect for adding more protein and fiber into my diet (dried beans are also a very economical option).<br /><br />Instant Indian is divided into 11 chapters, including regions, spices and kitchen basics, make-ahead basics (homemade paneer, masala paste, spice blends, and no-knead naan), breakfast and snacks (idlis, upma, dosas), rice and noodles, legumes and soups, vegetables and paneer, fish and shrimp, chicken and eggs, lamb and pork, desserts and drinks, and chutneys and raitas. You’ll find many restaurant favorites like alu gobi, tikka masala, butter chicken, saag paneer, and yogurt lassi.<br /><br />For my review, I tested several recipes from different chapters including the tamatar masala anda, rajma with azuki beans, anda rassa, benarasi alu dum, and misthi pulao. I tested all recipes in a 3-qt. Instant Pot. The flavor of the misthi pulao was absolutely amazing due to sauteeing the spices in ghee first.<br /><br />One suggestion I’ve found helpful is it’s well worth purchasing several additional accessories for your Instant Pot: at a minimum, buy extra seals (I find the color-coded ones particularly helpful) as smells tend to linger, if you cook curries often it’s worth having a seal just for those. My other suggestion is purchasing the clear glass lid for making yogurt. The hardboiled egg stand / silicone roasting rack by OXO is great too. And if you plan on making idlis, you’ll need to purchase an idli mold that will fit inside your Instant Pot.<br /><br />Each recipe includes serving size, total time breakdown (this is important with the instant pot, as in addition to prep time you also have to factor in time for the pot to come to pressure, cooking time, and natural or manual pressure release), and whether each recipe is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian (many of the vegetarian recipes can be made vegan by swapping coconut ghee or using firm tofu for paneer). As a huge fan of chutneys (which are difficult to find and expensive in Japan), I love making my own using Rinku’s recipes (at first I used her slow cooker version, now I love the sweet and tangy pineapple chutney from Instant Indian!).<br /><br />The index is extremely user-friendly and thorough and not only includes recipes by ingredient, but also grouped by breakfast dishes, main dishes, etc.<br /><br />There are numerous delicious ideas for sauteed and curried vegetable medleys using readily available vegetables and seasonings that will add color and nutrition to every meal, and enough variety to keep me happily cooking for months. Recipes are also labelled as vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free, making it super-convenient for those who follow those diets.<br /><br />Whether you are a longtime fan of Indian cuisine or simply looking for new recipes to incorporate using your Instant Pot, “Instant Indian” is a fantastic resource that deserves a place in your kitchen!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Having been a vegetarian for over a decade, I am always on the lookout for new and unusual ideas to add into my lunch and dinner rotation. \"PNW Veg\" collects 100 recipes inspired by the Pacific Northwest, with nods to regional ingredients like fiddlehead ferns, sea beans, and stinging nettles. The style calls to mind Ottolenghi\\'s blending of international influences; you\\'ll find Hispanic, Korean,and Middle Eastern inspirations.<br /><br />A note of caution: if you do not have access to a good grocery store, a lot of these dishes may be out of your reach. Also, the flavor combinations may be a little unfamiliar for some (spiced parsnips with blue cheese yogurt sauce, artichokes with lavender-rosemary crumbs and miso butter).<br /><br />Personally, I loved the variety in the soups, salads, sides and mains, but I save these dishes for weekends and special occasions. I love the creative use of veggies in new and flavorful ways, and especially the whole grains and pasta chapter.<br /><br />I also appreciated that recipes are clearly marked as vegan and gluten-free in both the index and the recipes themselves.<br /><br />Verdict: If you are game for sometimes \"exotic\" flavor pairings and don\\'t mind some lengthy prep times (I would call this \"vegetarian gourmet\"), this is a great choice for elegant vegetarian dishes (especially for holidays or special occasions.)',\n",

       "  'text': 'This book is an excellent read for fans of Wilson Pickett or soul music in general.  It provides inside information, a behind the scenes look, so to speak, about the recordings of Wilson Pickett.  There are stories of how songs were written and what went on in the studios when Pickett’s records were made.  The inner workings of studios like Stax in Memphis or Fame in Muscle Shoals are described in detail, and many of the musicians who played a significant role in Pickett’s recordings are identified.  Even readers who are well versed in the history of soul music are likely to learn something new from reading Tony Fletcher’s book.<br /><br />The personal side of Wilson Pickett’s life is another story, however.  He was a troubled individual whose self-destructive behavior stood in sharp contrast to his enormous talent.  Fletcher provides a complete picture of the man, both good and bad.  Wilson Pickett should probably best be remembered for the many outstanding recordings that made him a soul music legend, but for those readers who want to know the whole story of a complicated artist, Tony Fletcher’s well-researched Pickett biography is probably the best place to look.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Classic French dishes in (nearly) an Instant!',\n",
       "  'text': 'Some of my favorite cookbooks in my very large collection are Michele Scicolone\\'s three slow cooker cookbooks (French Slow Cooker, Italian Slow Cooker and Mediterranean Slow Cooker). In the past, I used to use my slow cookers (a Hamilton Beach and an All-Clad) quite regularly, but the last several years I haven\\'t had the time or have been on the go.<br /><br />This year, I finally jumped on the Instant Pot bandwagon and have slowly been increasing my confidence in my ability to get dinner on the table using it. (I have the 3-qt model, so appreciate when recipes don\\'t have to be scaled down in order to make). I\\'ve also learned that it\\'s better at some tasks than others (I love it for quickly cooking grains and dried beans, but still prefer to steam my veggies rather than pressure cook them). I\\'ve been experimenting with several Indian Instant Pot titles and was eager to try out the \"Instantly French\" cookbook, which features classics like French onion soup, creme brulee, Chicken Provencal, rilletes, pate, pistou, etc. to see how they fared in the pressure cooker.<br /><br />I tried several of the dishes including the French lentil salad with beets and goat cheese, roquefort walnut mini quiches, and salmon with melted leeks and whole-grain mustard. It\\'s important to note that the Instant Pot is used to prep in some cases, but recipes may still require finishing in the oven / under the broiler. This is great, because a) it still cuts total cooking time, and b) the finished dish is crispy (which the Instant Pot will NOT deliver in pressure cooker mode).  I love the all-in-one convenience of being able to saute, simmer, and pressure cook in the same appliance!<br /><br />It was my first time trying fish in the Instant Pot (if you are cooking meats, fish, veggies regularly, you may wish to also purchase optional color-coded seals so smells don\\'t carry over). as well as a silicone roasting trivet (I have OXOs). Don\\'t be alarmed that cook times on fish and meat may be as short as one minute, because the pressure cooker still takes around 5 minutes to come up to pressure, and at least 10 minutes on natural release, during which time your food will continue to cook. The Salmon with Melted Leeks is going to be a regular fixture in my house; leeks are sauteed, steamed and then sour cream is stirred through, making them creamy (it reminds me of the Polish cabbage and noodles my grandmother used to make). The salmon is plated on top and finished with a dollop of mustard. There\\'s another similar recipe for salmon with olive and almond tapenade.For meat eaters, you\\'ll find beef in red wine, veal stew, braised pork with apples, even lamb and duck.<br /><br />I really liked that the index was in French and English as well.<br /><br />If I could make one suggestion, it would be to include some suggested sample menus on how to pair the included appetizers, soups and veggies with mains for different occasions, but overall this is quickly becoming one of my favorite Instant Post cookbooks and one that I use frequently.',\n",

The index includes recipe names in both transliterated Arabic and English, as well as grouping by ingredient.<br /><br /> For my review, I made several of the salads including the watermelon, feta and mint salad, lentil salad, and beet salad. All were delicious, with a minimum of fresh, seasonal ingredients and just the right amount of seasoning to accentuate without overpowering. As is common in the Middle East and Mediterranean, I prepared several dishes and served them together to be scooped with flatbread. I have flagged many other recipes from “The Iraqi Table,” and look forward to continuing to cook my way through this gorgeous tribute to Iraq’s diverse, delicious and healthful cuisine.<br /><br />Anyone who is interested in Middle Eastern cuisine will want to add this gorgeous book to their collection.<br /><br />Congratulations to Ms. Al Safi on a beautiful cookbook and on your Gourmand Award!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Berlin-based Meike Peters’ lifelong love of food was instilled in her by her mother and grandmothers. Rooted in German comfort food, her style has also embraced French and Italian cuisine as well as her partner’s Maltese and American traditions. Her blog (and cookbook) Eat In My Kitchen has collected hundreds of beautiful, vegetable-forward recipes that highlight seasonal ingredients, using a minimum of preparation to enhance the delicate textures and flavors of the various seasonal fruits and veggies they showcase. “Eat In My Kitchen” was just named the James Beard Foundation’s top General Cooking title of 2017, and rightfully so!<br /><br />Kicking off with salads, you’ll find a wide range of tempting plates such as the fennel and melon carpaccio with chervil, cucumber, arugula, and orange salad with turmeric and mint, roasted peppers and cherry tomatoes with burrata, lemon and basil, Radicchio, peach, and roasted shallot salad with blue cheese, and red cabbage and pomegranate salad with candied walnuts and rosemary. I made several of these for quick and easy weeknight suppers, and was impressed by both their appearance (beautiful), ease of assembly, and the wide range of flavors and textures coaxed from a minimum of fuss. The melon and fennel carpaccio made a fantastic light dinner alongside a glass of sparkling rose; the contrast between the crunch of the fennel, juicy melon and bright herbal notes from the chervil was a lovely surprise.<br /><br />Vegetarians will find many outstanding dishes ready-made for them, including the salad chapter as well as many lovely pastas (Maltese lemon and ricotta pasta with basil, cicero e tria, wild mushroom spaghetti with orange butter and crispy sage, pumpkin gnocchi with Roquefort sauce), mains (grilled eggplant, ricotta, chickpea and poached egg tartine, torta al testo with lemon-rosemary lentil burgers and mozzarella di buffala, roasted shallot, caramelized plum, and stilton tartine with rosemary, roasted garlic and tomato focaccia sandwich with rosemary oil), basalmic strawberry, chevre, and pistachio tartine).<br /><br />Meat, poultry and seafood lovers will be delighted to find treasures such as the Bavarian beer-roasted pork with sweet potatoes and parsnips, Riesling and elderflower chicken with apricots, slow-roasted duck with ginger, honey and orange, Maltese tuna and spinach pie, and swordfish with mint, tomatoes and lemon-caper oil.<br /><br />Meike also touches on sweet and savory baking, from Gozitan pizza and a beautiful pear and blue cheese tart with rosemary to German-inspired bakes (Frankfurter krantz, cardamom kipferl, Donauwelle, butter Buchtel buns), Mediterranean-inspired recipes (polenta-almond cake with rosewater-vanilla syrup, Maltese bread pudding, lemon ricotta cannoli), and a glorious strawberry-ricotta cheesecake with oat cookie crust.<br /><br />The beauty of Meike’s recipes is in their simplicity; with few exceptions, most recipes call for a mere handful of ingredients and straightforward prep. “To cook, to bake, to eat, and to treat is my daily feast,” she writes. Ingredients are listed in US as well as metric measurements, a fact which I greatly appreciate as I prefer to cook and bake in metric (weight) rather than US volume measurements as I feel it results in more accurate dishes. She also recommends using organic produce and ingredients whenever possible, preferably homegrown in the case of herbs. As fresh ricotta is difficult to come by here in Japan, I make my own Meyer lemon ricotta using the basic recipe from “One-Hour Cheese.” The resulting dishes are light, refreshing, and capture the essence of breezy summer days.<br /><br /> Homemade preserves will enhance your breakfasts and bakes with love, from elderflower syrup (used in the panna cotta recipe as well as a great enhancement for cocktails), spicy rhubarb chutney, Moroccan preserved lemons, and vegetable broth.<br /><br />And one of my favorite features is the “Meet in Your Kitchen,” section, which includes recipes from Yossy Arefi (“Sweeter off the Vine” and her blog “Apt. 2B Baking Co.”), television host Cynthia Barcomi, salt producers the Cini Family, Malin Elmlid of The Bread Exchange, Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, and blogger / author Molly Yeh (whose cookbook “Molly on the Range” was one of my Top Cookbooks of 2016).<br /><br />Because after all, the deepest, truest connections of food and taste are when we share the fruits of our labors with those we love – food as not merely sustenance, but as a springboard for leisurely conversations and taking a moment to slow down and savor in an all-too-hectic world.<br /><br />Congratulations to Meike for winning her James Beard award and congratulations on a fantastic cookbook!',\n",

       "  'title': 'Palestine On A Plate',\n",
       "  'text': 'Over the last 10 years, I’ve taught hundreds of students from the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait. Bedouins and poets, engineers and pilots, all ended up in my classroom, and we bonded over a love of good food, culture, and stories shared over tiny cups of aromatic, cardamom-laced Saudi coffee, dates from royal orchards, and sugar-soaked pastries their wives had lovingly prepared that morning.<br /><br />I’ve long been drawn to the cuisine of the Mediterranean and Middle East, with its rich bounty of fresh herbs, vegetables, and olive oil paired with tangy yogurt cheeses and garlicky dips. However, until recently, I had zero experience with the cuisine and culture of Palestine until receiving a copy of Joudie Kalla’s exquisite “Palestine on a Plate” (one of my blog’s Top Cookbooks of 2016) and taking a hands-on Palestinian class in Tokyo two weeks ago.<br /><br />Like many staple dishes common throughout the Middle East, there’s a long, rich history of shared lineage (hummus, falafel, ful, stuffed grape leaves), of not wasting a morsel (recycled bread salads such as fattoush), and making the most of the season’s bounty. Joudie grew up in a Palestinian household; the recipes in the book are methods and ingredients learned from her mother and grandmothers. Although some dishes have been adapted for modern sensibilities (less fat, less fuss, and less time-consuming), all are true to traditional Palestinian cooking.<br /><br />Beginning with a lovingly photographed guide to “my world of ingredients,” chapters include “Good Morning Starters” (ijeh, ful mudammas, fattet hummus, figs with labneh and honey on toasted bread, gorgeous sumac-y tomatoes, fluffy za’atar buns), hearty pulses and grains (freekeh-stuffed peppers, freekeh salad with marinated chicken and pomegranate dressing, lentil and beetroot salad with parsley and sumac dressing and grilled halloumi, maftoul tabbouleh, falafel, kubbeh), an entire chapter devoted to vibrant vegetarian dishes (tabbouleh-stuffed vine leaves, spinach and cheese parcels, mutabbal three ways, stuffed vegetables), lamb and chicken (makloubeh, kufta bil tahineh, warak inab, shakriyeh, fatayer, za’atar chicken), fish (saffron and lemon cod, mullet, sea bream, sumac and za’atar roasted monkfish, as well as squid, prawns, and shellfish), and a gorgeous dessert chapter that recalled the dishes shared with students: Yaffa orange cheesecake, m’t’abak, namoura, rosewater rice pudding, mandarin orange blossom cake, and very moreish tahini brownies.<br /><br />As is standard for books I review, I chose several recipes to test and photograph: the lentil and beetroot salad with parsley and sumac dressing with grilled halloumi, sumac tomatoes, za’atar buns (I used fresh yeast), and mandarin orange blossom cake. Finding fresh beetroot and imported halloumi was a bit of a Herculean challenge in Japan, but one that was well worth it.<br /><br />Recalling Ottolenghi’s vibrant, stunning vegetable dishes, the lentil salad is my new go-to favorite for entertaining or festive dinners; the contrast of colors between the fluorescent beetroot, silky preserved lemons and bright punch from the parsley is visually impressive as well as a delicious contrast of textures and flavors. The sumac dressing (which includes white wine vinegar and lemon juice) and preserved lemons add a bright (but not overpowering) acidity, while the grilled halloumi adds a savory counterpoint.<br /><br />The za’atar buns are based on a recipe of Nigella Lawson’s and produced a moist, fluffy roll that pairs well with hearty soups or spreads. Finally, the mandarin orange cake was an interesting one as the flour is composed entirely of semolina, an ingredient normally used in namoura / revani / basboussa that is baked then bathed with a fragrant orange blossom-laced sugar syrup. Made with olive oil and whole boiled oranges, it keeps wonderfully moist for several days. I opted to bake it in my NordicWare Citrus loaf pans and topped with candied orange slices.<br /><br />The recipes worked flawlessly as written; I opted to test in metric rather than the US conversions. Most ingredients should be readily available at your local grocery, with the exception of some of the grains (maftoul, freekeh) and seasonings (za’atar, rosewater, orange blossom water).<br /><br />Gorgeous photography by Ria Osbourne beautifully captures the finished dishes, along with scenes of vibrant everyday life in Palestine (markets, kitchens, street scenes, quiet moments at rest). The vegetarian chapter alone is worth the price of admission, plus I loved that many dishes come together quickly. Too often, I find myself purchasing cookbooks that are beautiful to look at but woefully impractical for weeknight cooking; not so with “Palestine on a Plate.” I also appreciated that Joudie includes healthier options for baking instead of deep-frying as I try to keep an eye on my fat intake and generally avoid fried foods.<br /><br />Joudie’s tribute to her family, her home, and her rich Palestinian heritage is one that deserves a place of honor on your cookbook shelf; not only gorgeous to look at, every dish begs to be made and devoured, and Joudie’s prose will flood your senses with the sights, sounds, and smells of a Palestinian kitchen.',\n",

       "  'text': \"As a huge fan of Persian cuisine and novels such as [[ASIN:0812972481 Pomegranate Soup: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1565129571 Maman's Homesick Pie: A Persian Heart in an American Kitchen]], I eagerly dove into &#34;The Temporary Bride,&#34; not realizing at first that it was in fact autobiographical. Jennifer Klinec, the daughter of hardscrabble Eastern European immigrants, grew up in a rural Ontario town and longed to see (and more importantly, taste) all the mysteries that the world had to offer. Independent from a young age, she moved between Swiss boarding school and an Irish college, a bank job in London, a food writer and and hands-on cooking around the globe (including Yemen and Syria) before chasing her dreams to Iran. Having operated a cooking school out of her London home, she at times finds so many restrictions chafing (women must wear a headscarf at all times, travel in a separate section of the bus, stand in separate lines, and are subject to scrutiny and inspections by the religious police, not to mention sexual harassment in the street).<br /><br />But Jennifer ends up signing up for something she hadn't bargained for: she falls in love with her host family's gruff son and becomes a temporary bride, marrying a man she's only known for three weeks. Vahid indulged her culinary curiosity by granting her access to every corner of Iran's foodways, introducing her to local specialties, and opening doors that would have otherwise been closed to her as a foreign woman, including an ill-fated visit to an abbatoir. The two began a whirlwind courtship. Living in rural Yadz, Jennifer and Vahid were under intense scrutiny by pretty much everyone, stealing kisses and hurried trysts in alleyways and in Jennifer's hotel room.<br /><br />Such temporary Sigheh marriages are ways to get around Iran's strict ban on extra-marital sex; some view them as legalized prostitution, while for Jennifer and Vahid, it offered a chance at normalcy.<br /><br />The writing is gorgeous, particularly the heady descriptions of savory stews and the chopping, peeling and food preparation; I felt like I had found a soulmate as I've had a similar love for Persian, Middle Eastern and Central Asian dishes since childhood and feel most alive and at home in foreign kitchens. Iran has long been a place I've dreamed of visiting and cooking my way around, and reading Jennifer's gorgeous prose brought modern Iran to vibrant life. I devoured the entire book in a day, and certainly look forward to reading more works by Jennifer!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Naturally I'm familiar with Mary Berry from her role as host on the Great British Bake-Off (I've followed the careers of several of the alumni including Edd Kimber, Ruby Tanoh, and Nadiya Hussein), but this was the first time I'd had the chance to peruse one of her many cookbooks. A legend in British culinary circles, Mary has published more than 75 cookbooks.<br /><br />In &#34;Cooking with Mary Berry,&#34; she presents beautifully photographed dishes that lean towards the basic (pizza tartlets, nachos, hummus), with a dash of well-known European dishes (coq au vin, chicken cordon bleu, boeuf bourguignon, mushroom stroganoff) and quite a few international influences in the form of Mexican / Tex-Mex (mole, shrimp tacos), Asian, and even Indian and Middle Eastern (including vegetarian dishes such as falafel).<br /><br />As Mary states in the introduction, her recipes have to meet three criteria: look good, taste good, and be practical to make. Her step-by-step technique photographs would be tremendously helpful for those new to the kitchen, and the limited number of ingredients make this a perfect cookbook for a student going off to college, for example. More experienced chefs will already know all of these tips and tricks, but it's nice to have a reminder from time to time! Some of the vegetarian dishes and sides appealed to me, although the recipes not surprisingly feature meat and seafood quite heavily. I'm also interested in trying Mary's breads and baked goods as that is what she is primarily known for.<br /><br />This would make a great gift for a budding chef in your life, or if you have basic cooking skills and are interested in trying more adventurous international dishes.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'and desserts just like those you get from your favorite Chinese',\n",
       "  'text': \"Kelly Kwok, founder of &#34;Life Made Sweeter,&#34; has unlocked the secret to delicious restaurant-style stir fries, noodles, curries, and desserts just like those you get from your favorite Chinese, Thai, or Korean restaurants, but without the sinkful of dirty dishes and piles of pots and pans! You'll find all your Chinese favorites like Beef and Broccoli, General Tso's Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Lo Mein along with Galbi (Korean-style short ribs), Thai curries, Bahn mi, tom yum, pho, fried rice, noodle dishes, sides and desserts.<br /><br />Most of these qualify as one-pot dishes (despite the title, not all involve the slow cooker), making prep and cleanup easy. Ingredients are listed in both US and metric equivalents, and most ingredients should be readily available at your grocery store. Each recipe has a gorgeous full-color photo as well. The sauces in particular are standouts, even more so considering that relatively few ingredients are used (so no trips to the Chinese/Oriental supermarket trying to track down hard-to-find sauces and pastes).<br /><br />As a vegetarian, I loved the Asian-inspired soups like the Thai pumpkin curry soup, miso soup with vegetables and soba noodles, and Chinese hot and sour soup. There is a whole chapter devoted to meatless mains, including a vegetarian mapodofu, Thai red curry vegetables, Chinese eggplant with garlic sauce, General Tso's Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes, and Thai basil tofu and vegetable rice casserole.<br /><br /> THAI BUTTERNUT SQUASH CURRY SOUP<br /><br />YIELD: 4–5 SERVINGS<br /><br />5 cups (2250 g) butternut squash (or pumpkin), peeled and cubed<br />1 cup (200 g) sweet potatoes, peeled, roughly cubed<br />1 medium onion, peeled, diced<br />1 tbsp (8 g) fresh ginger, peeled<br />3 garlic cloves, sliced<br />3 cups (710 ml) chicken or vegetable broth<br />1 (13.5-oz [400-ml]) can coconut milk<br />½–1 tbsp (8–16 g) red curry paste, to taste<br />½ tsp turmeric<br />1 tbsp (15 ml) fresh lime juice<br />Salt and pepper, to taste<br />Drizzle of coconut milk, for garnish (optional)<br />Pumpkin seeds, for garnish (optional)<br />Chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)<br />Sliced red chili pepper, for garnish (optional)<br /><br />Place the squash, sweet potatoes, onion, ginger, garlic and broth in a 4- to 5-quart (3.8- to 4.7-L) slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on high for 3 to 4 hours, until the squash and sweet potatoes are soft and cooked through.<br /><br />Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, red curry paste, turmeric and lime juice. Allow the soup to cool slightly before pur&eacute;eing. Using an immersion blender, pur&eacute;e directly in the slow cooker or pour contents into a blender and pur&eacute;e until smooth. Adjust seasonings as needed with salt and pepper.<br /><br />Serve warm in bowls and garnish with a drizzle of coconut milk, pumpkin seeds, cilantro and sliced red chili pepper, if desired.<br /><br />I love that so many of the ingredients are readily available; nothing is more frustrating than finding a dish that looks great, but not being able to locate specialty ingredients (especially true with some Chinese and Asian cookbooks).<br /><br />The addition of desserts was a nice touch as I love to use my slow cooker for desserts (I also highly recommend Michele Scicolone's &#34;The Mediterranean Slow Cooker&#34; for its desserts chapter). Here you'll find a mandarin orange cheesecake, Asian pear pudding cake, black sesame brownies, Chinese steamed sponge cake, ginger tea poached pears, Lunar New Year sweet rice cake, mango coconut tapioca pudding, matcha green tea cake, sweet green bean soup, and Thai coconut sticky rice with mango.<br /><br />Here is Kelly's recipe for Black Sesame Brownies: the ground black sesame seeds lend an almost peanut-butter-like depth.<br /><br /> BLACK SESAME BROWNIES<br />YIELD: 10 SERVINGS<br />1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour<br />¼ cup (30 g) unsweetened cocoa powder<br />2 tsp (5 g) black sesame powder or finely ground black sesame seeds<br />¾ tsp baking powder<br />¼ tsp salt<br />½ cup (58 g) unsalted butter<br />½ cup (90 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />1 cup (225 g) sugar<br />3 large eggs, lightly beaten<br />1 tsp pure vanilla extract<br />½ cup (90 g) semi-sweet mini chocolate chips, plus more for topping, if desired<br /><br />Take a long piece of aluminum foil and fold it lengthwise into a long strip. Press it along the inside perimeter of your slow cooker, creating a ring. This will prevent the edges from burning. Next, line the bottom with a piece of parchment, leaving an overhang on the sides for easier removal.<br />In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sesame powder, baking powder and salt.<br /><br />Place the butter and chocolate chips in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high power for 30-second increments, stirring well after each, until completely smooth and melted. Whisk in the sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one by one, then add the vanilla.<br /><br />Slowly stir in the flour mixture until just combined; do NOT overmix. Fold in the mini chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the lined slow cooker and smooth out using a rubber spatula. Top with additional chocolate chips if desired.<br /><br />Cover the slow cooker with a double layer of paper towels then place the lid securely over the towels. This prevents any water from dripping into the cake batter.<br /><br />Cook on low for 21⁄2 to 3 hours, then remove the cover and cook for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the insert from the slow cooker and allow to cool completely. Lift the parchment paper to remove the brownies and slice into squares.<br /><br />Kelly has also provided a handy guide to browning, cuts of meat, layering, sizes and brands of slow cookers, and general tips. In addition, a section on the Asian pantry includes a brief overview of staples such as black bean sauce / paste, sambal oelek, coconut milk, doenjang, dried chilis, fish sauce, spices, and other seasonings that you'll need to create the dishes in &#34;The Asian Slow Cooker.&#34;<br /><br />Verdict: If you love Asian cuisine but think you don't have the time to create it at home, think again! &#34;The Asian Slow Cooker&#34; will have you throwing out your takeout menus in favor of easy homemade versions with far fewer additives, plus there is enough variety and range of Asian cuisines (Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Korean) to keep you happily cooking for months to come. Happy (slow) cooking!<br /><br />(Thank you to YC Media for permission to reprint recipes and photos from The Asian Slow Cooker!)\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Like a warm hug from Bubbe!',\n",
       "  'text': 'I first heard of Miri Rotkovitz’s “Bubbe And Me in the Kitchen” via Facebook, where I’m a member of several Jewish and kosher groups. I adore classic Jewish comfort food; although I didn’t grow up in a Jewish household, my Polish great-grandmother was a cook for wealthy Jewish families in Poland, and some staple dishes of my childhood were very similar (stuffed cabbage rolls, kasha with mushrooms, buckwheat knishes, poppyseed strudel). Some of my earliest memories in the kitchen are of baking with my Polish grandmother, so I was eager to see how Miri took classic dishes and added modern twists.<br /><br />From the very first pages, “Bubbe and Me” is like a warm hug from grandma; I loved the author’s family photos and memories, along with “In the Kitchen With…” recollections and recipes by many famous Jewish cookbook authors such as Paula Shoyer (I reviewed her “Holiday Kosher Baker” for Mediterranean Living), Kim Kushner (see my review of &#34;The New Kosher,&#34;) Ronnie Fein, and others.<br /><br />Breakfast includes classic updates on lox and bagels (hot-smoked salmon bagels with herbed goat cheese and veggies), challah strata, and an amazing pareve apricot pistachio babka, while you’ll find a delicious spread of meze (muhammara and za’atar pita chips, smoky spice-roasted chickpeas, herbed feta), and an array of colorful and healthy salad ideas (I particularly loved the arugula, apple, and date salad with goat cheese and pecans and the purple cabbage slaw with toasted sesame ginger vinaigrette). You’ll find modern updates on matzoh balls (parlsey and nutmeg matzo balls, golden vegetable broth with dill matzo balls), schav (ruby chard and lemongrass schav), latkes, and kugel.<br /><br />As a pescetarian, I was thrilled by the many simple and delicious fish preparations, including penne with tuna, artichoke and capers (a great recipe for using up odds and ends in your pantry), Moroccan-spiced cod with oranges and olives, and the showstopping salt-crusted branzino with herbs will be sure to delight your fellow dinner guests. The pistachio and mint-crusted wild salmon with tzatziki (sadly I can only get Chilean farmed salmon, so this is a very occasional indulgence) was an eye-opener; the combination of flavorful pistachios with crunchy panko was a truly delicious and foolproof way to prepare salmon. Although I haven’t eaten poultry in over ten years, the recipes for pomegranate-lacquered roast chicken, marmalade-roasted chicken with potatoes, citrus chicken with clementine salsa, and easy apricot chicken looks like surefire crowdpleasers for Shabbat or family dinners.<br /><br />“Bubbe and Me in the Kitchen” is a tremendous blessing to my fellow vegetarians; the aforementioned salads, dips and vegetables are plentiful and largely vegetarian, from Romanesco with golden raisins and toasted almonds to healthy grain-based salads like basmati rice with sweet carrot and orange and forbidden rice salad with mango and ginger vinaigrette. There’s even an entire chapter of meatless mains, from kasha varnishkes with ratatouille and a roasted beet reuben to vegetarian paella, white bean cassoulet, matzoh spanakopita and cauliflower “couscous” with vegetable tagine. You’ll even find a vegan challah! All too often, vegetarian and vegan dishes are few in many mainstream kosher cookbooks, so I really appreciated this touch (for a completely vegan kosher take on Jewish foods, check out my friend Estee Rahiv’s new cookbook “Oy Vey Vegan.&#34;<br /><br />Naturally, what Bubbe isn’t known for her baking and confections? I loved the dried plums and apricots with almond paste and almonds, Satva’s semi-famous Jewish apple cake, chocolate orange ricotta cheesecake, and poppyseed hamantaschen dough with fruit filling. There is a chapter included on holidays as well, with a handy table of Passover ingredient substitutions and index of Passover recipes and a selection of menus for Rosh Hashannah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Chanukah, Passover, Lag B’Omer, Shavuot, Tu B’Av, and Shabbat.<br /><br />Overall, “Bubbe and Me in the Kitchen” is a must-have addition to your cookbook library whether you keep kosher or are simply interested in Jewish comfort foods; out of the dozens of kosher cookbooks I own, I think this one will see weekly use as the recipes are delicious, approachable, and include many international influences (particularly Japanese / Asian). Thank you to Miri for preserving and updating these classic dishes for future generations, and most importantly, for remembering and recognizing the importance our bubbes played in our lives both in and out of the kitchen!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Some of my earliest food memories revolve around the smell and taste of the fresh yeast bread my Polish grandmother would bake in her small apartment kitchen in Michigan…for me, there is no more comforting aroma than that of freshly-baked bread. In a sort of alchemy, humble ingredients are transformed into an expression of baking talent and love. I’ve lived in five countries and visited several others, and sampling local breads and baked goods is one of the first things I set out to do.<br /><br />My large baking collection features numerous books on breads and baking, including several editions of the seminal “The Italian Baker” by Carol Field, my staple “Artisan Bread in 5,” Crumb: A Baking Book, Honey & Co The Baking Book, and the new Breaking Breads: A New World of Israeli Baking--Flatbreads, Stuffed Breads, Challahs, Cookies, and the Legendary Chocolate Babka, and I’m pleased to report that “Panetteria: Gennaro’s Italian Bakery” now holds a spot of honor as well.<br /><br />Gennaro Contaldo, Italian chef and restauranteur who mentored Jamie Oliver, grew up surrounded by a family of bakers, from spending hours in his uncle’s bakery to waking up to his mother’s home baking. As a baker at The Neal Street Restaurant, he was responsible for making the bread, focaccia, torte salate, pastry and seasonal bakes. As he mentioned in the foreword, bread and baked goods mean tradition, and you’ll find various bakes from across Italy and in honor of various seasons and holidays.<br /><br />Beginning with basic bread dough and grissini, you’ll find recipes for panini, stuffed breads, focaccia (garlic and rosemary, cheese, peppers, potato, red onion and pancetta), pizze (Bianca, marinara, 4-cheese, greens, individual pizzas), stuffed pies (spinach, guanciale, courgette and ricotta), sweet breads (plaited sweetbread, aniseed and currant ring cake, pandoro, brioche, colomba), crostate (tarts: ricotta and Nutella, dried apricot, strawberry and peach, creamy limoncello tart with grated chocolate, pumpkin), biscotti, cantucci, and torte (pear and chocolate, polenta and almond cake, yogurt and orange ring cake, marbled espresso loaf cake). Many of the recipes are influenced by Tuscany (including autumnal favorite castagnaccio), and you’ll note that some recipes do not include salt as is traditional – so you may choose to add at your own discretion. Ingredients are listed in metric as well as US volume and weight measurements, a thoughtful touch that makes it much easier for US bakers. And many recipes feature gorgeous matte photographs of the final bakes.<br /><br />For this review, I made three recipes, including the grape and rosemary buns, tricolor braided loaf, and the aniseed and currant cake.<br /><br />The grape and rosemary buns did not include salt in the recipe, and I would definitely add about ½ tsp next time as the sweetness of the grapes could use the balance from a pinch of salt. Also, the shaping instructions were rather vague (“form the dough into little basket shapes”) and I must have rolled mine too tightly as I could not get my dough spirals to resemble the photo, but they were delicious nonetheless and froze beautifully.<br /><br />The second recipe I tried was the treccia colorata, with three different flavors (saffron walnut, rum raisin, chocolate and orange). This was extremely time-consuming (start to finish, it was a four-hour project) and messy, and I felt like I may have overworked the dough trying to knead in the cocoa powder after the first rise – next time, I would add in the flavoring during the initial mixing / kneading by dividing the dough before the first rise. The final loaf was a touch dry, but made fantastic toast and looked gorgeous on the table.<br /><br />The final recipe (and my personal favorite of the three) was the aniseed and currant ring cake. I was happily surprised to find both currants and Sambuca widely available here in Japan, and set out to make the cake (I used a 10-cup NordicWare Bundt pan). This was the easiest recipe of the three, and very easy to assemble (it only requires a brief knead). The final texture was delightfully soft, fragrant, and makes fantastic toast.<br /><br />My next challenge will be the chestnut squares as chestnuts are in season here in Japan; in fact, one of my former students gifted me with some gorgeous chestnuts from his tree, so I look forward to baking with them.<br /><br />Overall, “Panetteria: Gennaro’s Italian Bakery” is a delightful addition to your baking library that fans of Italian breads and pastries will definitely want to own!',\n",

       "  'title': 'from dry fruit and nuts (Shirini) lending sweetness to more pungent ginger',\n",
       "  'text': \"As a longtime fan of Persian and Indian cuisines, I was intrigued when I saw my friend Marlene Spieler mention Niloufer Mavalvala's &#34;The Art of Parsi Cooking.&#34; Despite my familiarity with Persian and some regional Indian cuisines, I was not familiar with Parsi culture. The Parsi are followers of the Prophet Zarathushtra. The Parsi (from the word &#34;Pars,&#34; Iran), are Zoroastrians who migrated to India between the 8th to 10th centuries, and later their descendants who settled around the globe. Parsi cooking was largely shaped by Iran and India, and you'll find that both cultures feature prominently in Parsi dishes, from dry fruit and nuts (Shirini) lending sweetness to more pungent ginger, garlic, chilies and spices from India. The trinity of tikhu-khatu-mithu (spicy-sour-sweet) forms the underpinnings of Parsi cuisine.<br /><br />The included dishes in &#34;The Art of Parsi Cooking&#34; are arranged by course, from appetizers such as scrambled eggs with spices and prawns in spices and beloved side dishes like eggs on potatoes, okra or tomatoes and fish with green chutney in banana leaves to main dishes like shrimp coconut curry and rice, chicken curry with vegetable palau, Sunday lamb roast, and chicken almond and yogurt curry. And of course, what meal is complete without a spot of dessert? You'll find the famous Parsi wedding dish of \\xa0Lagan nu Custard and almond and rice pudding to Parsi kulfi (burnt\\xa0milk ice-cream with pistachio and almond) and ravo (semolina and egg pudding). Teatime snacks also offer a nice light pick-me-up, including butter biscuits, cake, and sweet pancakes. A discussion of spice blends is also included. Best of all, many of the spices and ingredients should be readily available in your local supermarket or Amazon (I've tried to cook from some &#34;authentic&#34; Indian cookbooks where I couldn't locate any of the regional veggies or obscure ingredients, so this is a huge relief!).<br /><br />Each beautifully illustrated recipe comes with helpful tips, and I love that the book was printed with large, bold font for ingredients, making it easy to see and cook from. I loved the brown rice recipe; not to be confused with whole grain rice, this is basmati rice that gets its color from caramelized onions and is delicately spiced with cinnamon, cloves, peppercorn, and cardamom. The baked goods were also a fascinating and delicious departure from more syrupy, often-too-sweet Indian desserts such as gulab jamun; I loved the light, semolina-enhanced kumas and the delicately-spiced butter cookies.<br /><br />As we move into fall and winter's chill, I look forward to cooking my way through more of these delicious, warming dishes that have sustained generations of Parsi cooks and families.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My first introduction to &#34;Cult Recipes&#34; was last year's &#34;Tokyo Cult Recipes,&#34; which I can't recommend highly enough. The &#34;Cult Recipes&#34; books are a virtual stroll around some of the world's great cities (Venice, New York, Tokyo, Istanbul), with detailed maps, itineraries, and supporting recipes to match. The included photographs capture the vibrant people and places, as well as mise en place and various markets and ingredients.<br /><br />Turkish cuisine is probably my favorite and I have numerous Turkish books in my collection, so I was eager to see how this would stack up.<br /><br />From the gorgeous gold-embossed cover to the unique black-and-white cartoons, &#34;Istanbul Cult Recipes&#34; is a fantastic love song to the city. True to Turkish cuisine, the bulk of the recipes are for meze, including a vibrant beetroot couscous, chopped salad with walnuts, and purslane salad, kebabs, pilavs, and veg-friendly mains (lentil kofte, hot salads, black-eyed peas with tomato, sarma, etc.). The street food chapter introduced me to some new favorites (I had no idea that giant baked potatoes were popular outside the US), while the &#34;Sweet Things&#34; chapter doesn't disappoint with kadayif, kunefe, muhallebi, kurabiye, lokma, Turkish delight and baklava. I loved the pumpkin dessert and baked quince ideas. The illustrated pastries and condiments, grains and pulses, and dried herbs and spices charts were also tremendously helpful. Recipes are listed in metric / US volume / US weight measurements, which I greatly appreciated (more and more UK titles are doing this thankfully!).<br /><br />The recipes themselves are simple and straightforward, and most don't require extensive prep or cooking time, making it easy to prepare several dishes to be served together, as is the tradition in Turkey.<br /><br />A fantastic collection to your cookbook library and one of my top cookbooks of 2016!\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Delicious Mediterranean meze and baked goods, but needs some minor edits',\n",
       "  'text': \"Several years ago, a fellow cookbook collector gifted me a copy of Ana Sortun's excellent [[ASIN:0060792280 Spice: Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean]], and I fell instantly and madly in love. Sortun is the executive chef behind Oleana and Sofra. Classically trained at La Varenne, she decided to incorporate Mediterranean spices and the mezze mentality after studying in Turkey. Sofra Cafe and Bakery opened in 2008 and serves mezze and baked goods from Turkey, Lebanon, and Greece, all of which are amply represented in &quot;Soframiz.&quot;<br /><br />I've long admired Turkish cuisine and have collected numerous books on the subject (including recent releases [[ASIN:1743368577 Istanbul Cult Recipes]], [[ASIN:1849496633 Eat Istanbul: A Journey to the Heart of Turkish Cuisine]], and [[ASIN:1743360495 Anatolia: Adventures in Turkish Cooking]]), so when I heard that Ana and Maura Kilpatrick were coming out with a Sofra cookbook, I was ecstatic. I've had the galley for several months, and have made numerous recipes from the book, including the spicy tomato bulgur salad, stuffed simit, Persian carrot and black eyed pea salad, and tahini shortbread cookies.<br /><br />The recipes include breakfast, meze, flatbreads, savory pies, cookies and confections, specialty pastries, cakes and desserts, and beverages. If you've never experienced a Turkish (or Israeli) breakfast, you're in for a treat; traditional breakfast spreads include many small bowls and plates of olives, tahini, stuffed flatbreads, egg dishes, vegetables and cheeses taking up the entire table. Breakfast at Sofra includes such staples as Shakshuka (baked eggs with spicy tomato sauce), rolled omelet with za'atar and labne, flower pogaca rolls, date orange brioche tart, pistachio toaster pastries with rosewater glaze, and morning buns iwth orange blossom glaze.<br /><br />The meze really shine and make for inspired snacking or afternoon pick-me-ups, from the whipped cheese spreads and hummus to hearty and healthy bean-based salads (Persian carrot and black-eyed peas, Egyptian-style pea salad with walnuts, barley and chickpea salad, yellow split peas with za'atar spiced almonds). I made several for this review and all were definite repeats.<br /><br />My true passion is baking, so the breads and baked goods were the real test. My first disappointment was that measurements are only given in volume, not weight; as a serious home baker, I much prefer the precision of weighing my flours, particularly as I live in an extremely humid climate (which affects the weight of flour). I also had some issues with several of the bread recipes I tried; the stuffed simit featured on the cover calls for 1 cup water to 2 1/4 cups of flour, and what initially greeted me was almost like pancake batter. I continued to add flour by the tablespoon, as well as a little olive oil, and eventually had a very soft (but workable) dough that was wonderfully moist. The Turkish method of brushing with pekmez (grape molasses) lends a sweet finish to the savory filling of feta and za'atar spiced almonds and the toasted sesame seed topping. The bread is delicious on its own or as an accompaniment to the salads in the book.<br /><br />Fans of Middle Eastern pastries will be in heaven; from pistachio bird's nests (a recipe I have not encountered in my many other Turkish books) to Persian love cake, kunefe, umm Ali with caramelized apples, chocolate hazelnut baklava, brown butter pecan pie with espresso dates, date espresso ma'amoul, and milky walnut-fig baklava, this is a baker's paradise.<br /><br />I encountered an issue with the tahini shortbread cookies, which calls for 2 tsp salt; I cross-checked the recipe on the internet, and the online version I found also called for 2 tsp. salt. My baker's instinct told me to start with much less; I went with 1/2 tsp salt, which is what most of the other cookie and shortbread recipes in &quot;Soframiz&quot; called for, and I'm certainly glad I didn't use the full amount as they would have been too salty for my taste. Also, I followed the recipe to the letter, and ended up with more like 3 or 4 dozen cookies. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup toasted sesame seeds but you are only instructed to use 1/4 cup. The resulting cookies were absolutely delicious and would be fantastic as part of a cheese tray as the sesame lends a savory edge.<br /><br />Gorgeous matte photography and clear, large font make this a pleasure to read and cook from (I prefer matte pages as it means no glare in my cookbook holder). I loved the recipes I tried, but found in several instances that there are small errors, so be sure to read through the entire recipe in advance and make note if an ingredient is mentioned that is not in the list, or an amount seems off.<br /><br />Overall &quot;Soframiz&quot; is one of my top cookbook picks for 2016 (I'll be releasing my 2016 cookbook roundup in the next month or two), and one that fans of Turkish, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine will certainly want to add to their collections.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Bring the flavors of Italy home!',\n",
       "  'text': 'Some of my earliest food memories revolve around the smell and taste of the fresh yeast bread my Polish grandmother would bake in her small apartment kitchen in Michigan…for me, there is no more comforting aroma than that of freshly-baked bread. In a sort of alchemy, humble ingredients are transformed into an expression of baking talent and love. I’ve lived in five countries and visited several others, and sampling local breads and baked goods is one of the first things I set out to do.<br /><br />My large baking collection features numerous books on breads and baking, including several editions of the seminal “The Italian Baker” by Carol Field, my staple “Artisan Bread in 5,” [[ASIN:1607748363 Crumb: A Baking Book]], [[ASIN:1444735004 Honey & Co The Baking Book]], and the new [[ASIN:157965682X Breaking Breads: A New World of Israeli Baking--Flatbreads, Stuffed Breads, Challahs, Cookies, and the Legendary Chocolate Babka]], and I’m pleased to report that “Gennaro’s Italian Bakery” now holds a spot of honor as well.<br /><br />Gennaro Contaldo, Italian chef and restauranteur who mentored Jamie Oliver, grew up surrounded by a family of bakers, from spending hours in his uncle’s bakery to waking up to his mother’s home baking. As a baker at The Neal Street Restaurant, he was responsible for making the bread, focaccia, torte salate, pastry and seasonal bakes. As he mentioned in the foreword, bread and baked goods mean tradition, and you’ll find various bakes from across Italy and in honor of various seasons and holidays.<br /><br />Beginning with basic bread dough and grissini, you’ll find recipes for panini, stuffed breads, focaccia (garlic and rosemary, cheese, peppers, potato, red onion and pancetta), pizze (Bianca, marinara, 4-cheese, greens, individual pizzas), stuffed pies (spinach, guanciale, courgette and ricotta), sweet breads (plaited sweetbread, aniseed and currant ring cake, pandoro, brioche, colomba), crostate (tarts: ricotta and Nutella, dried apricot, strawberry and peach, creamy limoncello tart with grated chocolate, pumpkin), biscotti, cantucci, and torte (pear and chocolate, polenta and almond cake, yogurt and orange ring cake, marbled espresso loaf cake). Many of the recipes are influenced by Tuscany (including autumnal favorite castagnaccio), and you’ll note that some recipes do not include salt as is traditional – so you may choose to add at your own discretion. Ingredients are listed in metric as well as US volume and weight measurements, a thoughtful touch that makes it much easier for US bakers. And many recipes feature gorgeous matte photographs of the final bakes.<br /><br />For this review, I made three recipes, including the grape and rosemary buns, tricolor braided loaf, and the aniseed and currant cake.<br /><br />The grape and rosemary buns did not include salt in the recipe, and I would definitely add about ½ tsp next time as the sweetness of the grapes could use the balance from a pinch of salt. Also, the shaping instructions were rather vague (“form the dough into little basket shapes”) and I must have rolled mine too tightly as I could not get my dough spirals to resemble the photo, but they were delicious nonetheless and froze beautifully.<br /><br />The second recipe I tried was the treccia colorata, with three different flavors (saffron walnut, rum raisin, chocolate and orange). This was extremely time-consuming (start to finish, it was a four-hour project) and messy, and I felt like I may have overworked the dough trying to knead in the cocoa powder after the first rise – next time, I would add in the flavoring during the initial mixing / kneading by dividing the dough before the first rise. The final loaf was a touch dry, but made fantastic toast and looked gorgeous on the table.<br /><br />The final recipe (and my personal favorite of the three) was the aniseed and currant ring cake. I was happily surprised to find both currants and Sambuca widely available here in Japan, and set out to make the cake (I used a 10-cup NordicWare Bundt pan). This was the easiest recipe of the three, and very easy to assemble (it only requires a brief knead). The final texture was delightfully soft, fragrant, and makes fantastic toast.<br /><br />My next challenge will be the chestnut squares as chestnuts are in season here in Japan; in fact, one of my former students gifted me with some gorgeous chestnuts from his tree, so I look forward to baking with them.<br /><br />Overall, “Gennaro’s Italian Bakery” is a delightful addition to your baking library that fans of Italian breads and pastries will definitely want to own! (Note: I reviewed the UK edition, but Interlink is also releasing an adapted version for US home bakers in the near future).',\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm probably one of the very few who purchased this cookbook without having ever actually SEEN the Great British Bake-Off or Nadiya on the small screen...chalk that up to several overseas moves and the last couple of years without a TV or cable. However, I was intrigued by the snippets of information out about her debut cookbook, and decided to preorder from the UK. Despite the lack of TV, I regularly follow the careers of former GBBO contestants and own cookbooks by several, including the excellent &#34;Crumb&#34; by Ruby Tanoh (one of my blog's top cookbooks of 2014) and Edd Kimber (&#34;The Boy Who Bakes&#34;).<br /><br />I love a good curry (Meera Sodha's books are some of my favorites), but due to a hectic work/life balance, I really fall for doable, delicious recipes with easy results, and &#34;Nadiya's Kitchen&#34; delivers on both counts. Nadiya grew up in a British Bangladeshi family in Luton, where she taught herself to cook from cookbooks and YouTube videos. In 2015, she was chosen to appear on Great British Bake-Off and won. An audience favorite, Nadiya now has a spinoff BBC documentary &#34;The Chronicles of Nadiya&#34; as well as several book deals (&#34;Nadiya's Kitchen,&#34; the children's book / cookbook &#34;Bake Me A Story,&#34; as well as her first novel).<br /><br />In her first cookbook, Nadiya collects familiar (British) favorites like the Full English (here presented as a frittata), meat pies, and cherry Bakewell with a hefty dose of the international (chilli cheese burritos, gnocchi with cheese, pine nuts and rocket, grilled halloumi with pomegranate salsa, kofta kebab, Asian-inspired seafood) as well as Indian and Bengali fare (meat samosas, korma, curry, kedgeree). True to her word, many recipes do come together quickly and are fairly simple. Thanks to the detailed step-by-step photographs for more involved recipes, even novice cooks can turn out a delicious dinner.<br /><br />The chapters are arranged by theme rather than meal (teatime, dessert for dinner, dinner date, cosy evenings and midnight feasts, etc.), so it may take a bit of flipping to locate the recipe or type of dish you're looking for.<br /><br />For this review, I made several recipes from &#34;Nadiya's Kitchen&#34; including the showstopping oven-roasted sweet tomato and Parmesan tart, mustard and kale mac and cheese, quick boiled egg curry, and sour cherry and almond Bundt cake. The tomato Parmesan tart has you essentially candy cherry tomatoes with a touch of sugar, balsamic and olive oil. If pressed for time, an all-butter refrigerated pie crust can be substituted for the homemade one. You first blind bake the crust before layering with half the tomatoes and adding a rich cheese-enhanced custard (I also added some sprigs of fresh thyme to add a little extra flavor).  This was absolutely lovely served with a simple green salad (and I actually prefer eating it cold rather than warm).<br /><br />Next up was the quick boiled egg curry. I usually have a surplus of hard-boiled eggs in the refrigerator (I steam them in batches in my rice cooker), and am always looking for new ways to use them, so I loved the idea of adding them to a curry. You start by cooking down tomatoes, onion, and spices into a dry paste, then frying up the eggs separately. Two observations here: first, the amount of paste hardly seems generous enough for six eggs / several servings if you like your curry a bit heartier / saucier (I ended up with maybe 1.5 cups of sauce after cooking down, which would yield 1/4 cup per person if serving six as Nadiya recommends). Second, I had less success with frying up the eggs. You're supposed to score them then crisp in oil, but mine browned unevenly and didn't result in the crisp &#34;shell&#34; shown. I ended up using peeled hardboiled eggs and mixing them into the curry, and loved the final result.<br /><br />The mustard and kale mac and cheese was a great update on a beloved classic; I added some panko breadcrumbs to the top as I love crunchy mac and cheese! If you can't find Coleman's mustard powder in your neck of the woods, French mustard or Japanese mustard powder is a respectable substitute. Kale being a tougher green, it froze and reheated beautifully and didn't turn slimy or mushy on reheating.<br /><br />And as Nadiya is primarily known as a baker, how do the selection of baked goods hold up? The first recipe I tried was the sour cherry and almond Bundt, and it was every bit as gorgeous as the photo. My coworkers loved the balance of cherries and subtle hint of almond (the recipe uses both almond flour, although not entirely gluten-free, as well as almond extract). The crumb was moist and the cake held up well through several days of snacking.<br /><br />There are also recipes for mocha macarons, homemade candy (peanut, black sesame and ginger brittle, chocolate-dipped honeycomb, candied orange peel, guava Turkish delight, salted pretzel fudge, speculoos hazelnut truffles), cookies galore (candied lemon, coconut and strawberry Anzacs, chocolate and date, matcha and milk chocolate), chocolate and hazelnut profiteroles, chocolate and star anise fondants, pavlovas and cream pies, nutmeg and orange baked cheesecake, raspberry jam puddle brownies, and a recipe for Her Majesty's Cake.<br /><br />From comfort food (hello, mushroom, cheese and mustard croissants!) to more elegant fare (fresh sea bass fennel ceviche, crusted rack of lamb with aubergine bortha, crispy filo with seared tuna), &#34;Nadiya's Kitchen&#34; offers something for everyone, from beginning cooks to the more experienced.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Delicious, approachable Greek comfort food',\n",
       "  'text': '“Cooking with Loula” is the beautiful cookbook-slash-memoir of Alexandra Stratou, Athens native and classically trained chef, that centers on the recipes of Kyria (Mrs.) Loula, her grandmother’s cook. Kyria Loula had worked for several generations of the Stratou family, creating dishes that nourished the physical body as well as sustained family traditions and memories.<br /><br />I first discovered this title on NetGalley (where I’ve been a reviewer for the past couple of years); as a huge fan of all things Greek, I was eager to dive into the galley (and later the physical copy). As I work full-time and have very little time for cooking during the week, I was hoping that the recipes would be on the simple side; luckily this is so, with short ingredient lists yet delicious results.<br /><br />I love that not only does Ms. Stratou include pantry staples, but also includes other essential tips, my personal favorite being “Bless your food when you reach the point where it could turn into a success or a failure.” A lovely illustrated guide to essential tools and a guide to cooking with the seasons rounds out the introduction. The seasonal chart will help you choose recipes based on what is in season at the moment (and of course, if you can support your local farmer’s market if you have one, your recipe will turn out all the better for it).<br /><br />And here is the major difference between Greek cooking and our modern lives: In Greece (particularly Crete), meals still revolve around seasonality. A tomato should only be consumed when in season, unlike the plastic tasteless varieties available year-round at American grocery stores. I subscribe to a biweekly organic CSA box from Nagano, and each week get to cook with sometimes new and novel ingredients (this week’s box included huge okra, eggplant, tomatoes, cucumbers, and red shiso), many of which also feature prominently in Greek cuisine.<br /><br />Recipes are arranged with the home cook in mind; weekday recipes are specifically geared towards the harried modern cook, featuring dishes that can be on the table in half an hour or less. These include spanakopita, gemista, pastitsio, tomato-stewed chicken with orzo, stuffed zucchini, and oven-baked sea bass. “Sundays” includes more ambitious recipes with longer cook times, designed to let you linger over the table with family. Standouts include Hunkiar Beyendi (beef stew with smoked eggplant puree), chicken pie, stuffed cabbage leaves, beef stifado, roast pork with apple and onion, and galaktoboureko.<br /><br />“Summer Holidays” includes lighter fare like kaiki tuna salad, black-eyed pea salad, mini cheese pies, octopus marinated in vinegar, and dips. Fried fish, oven-baked eggplant, grilled fish, potato salad, baklava and chocolate mousse round out the chapter. “Traditions” captures major Greek holidays, beginning with New Year’s (vasilopita), deep-fried salt cod (served on March 25), koulourakia (Easter butter cookies), Tsoureki (Easter bread), oven-roasted lamb (served on Holy Saturday), and Christmas cookies and cakes will all brighten your holiday table. “Essential Recipes” includes stocks, sauces (b&eacute;chamel, avgolemono, mayonnaise, kimas), and pastry cases (crusts). The book closes with beautiful dedications to Kyria Loula and Giagia Sofia.<br /><br />I’ve made several of the recipes from “Cooking With Loula,” beginning with the gemista (stuffed vegetables). My mother used to prepare stuffed peppers, but I was never a fan of green peppers in particular, so for this recipe I substituted the sweeter orange, red, and yellow bell peppers. In Japan it is difficult to find large tomatoes (heirlooms are apparently unknown here), so I used all peppers for stuffing, fitting them snugly into my Emile Henry pie dish. The end result was a delicious blend of rice (I used Arborio), raisins and pine nuts that thankfully also freezes supremely well (I had the leftovers for lunches the following week). Fellow vegetarians and pescetarians will be in heaven, as Greek cuisine is tremendously vegetarian-friendly (aided by the large number of fasting days in the Greek Orthodox calendar).<br /><br />In Alexandra’s words, “This cookbook is as much about my family as any other. We all have our own stories, our own tastes, our own memories, but no matter what they are, when talking about them we speak the same language. The places of the past we travel to are highly personal, but the journey is universal. I hope you hold this book in your hands and take some time --- not only to cook, but to think about your past and what it means to you.” “Cooking with Loula” will send you forward on a delicious journey, not only to discover Loula’s recipes, but to reconnect and create your own lasting food memories (glass of Greek wine and Greek soundtrack in the background highly recommended but optional). Happy cooking!<br /><br />(This review originally published on BundtLust on 21 August 2016)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I own and have reviewed several (unofficial) Trader Joe’s cookbooks and cook from all of them regularly, so was excited to see “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s Cookbook.” It’s no secret that one of my favorite stores on the planet is Trader Joe’s. I first discovered them while still living in Michigan, and it would be an eight-year wait before my city in Texas got their first store (in the meantime, I would smuggle home suitcases full of TJ’s manna-like cookie butter and dried fruit). Although I currently live 8,000 miles away from the nearest store (and will for the next several years), I have a hefty supply of shelf-stable TJ’s products that friends and family are kind enough to send in care packages.<br /><br />So I was excited to see the new release “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s Cookbook: Over 75 Easy, Delicious Recipes for Every Meal.” A freelance illustrator, author Bonnie Matthews was hit hard by the economic downturn in 2008  and also saw the end to a seven-year relationship. She had gotten up to nearly 300 pounds before deciding that she needed to change; she started cooking healthier meals using Trader Joe’s products and eventually lost 130 pounds through a combination of healthier eating and working out. Her employee discount at Trader Joe’s meant that she had the chance to create delicious recipes that would let her stick to her newfound healthy lifestyle: “I had to make peace with food and make better choices or I knew that I would not be able to survive.” Dr. Oz dubbed Bonnie a “Wellness Warrior” on his show and gave Bonnie a blog on DoctorOz.com; this launched her journey as a cookbook author.<br /><br />Something that my loyal readers may not be aware of is that I lost and have kept off around 35 pounds for the last 15 years. Starting in junior high and high school, I began to pack on the pounds onto my 5’1” frame through a combination of junk food, soda, candy, and lack of exercise. In high school I weighed about 125; by the time I earned my BA from Western Michigan in 2003, that number had ballooned to over 140 and I barely fit into a size 12. I had finally had enough and changed my habits (and diet) drastically; I started to exercise every day, cut out regular sodas, stopped eating fast food, switched to whole grains, fresh vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and gradually adopted a vegetarian (now pescetarian) diet. In a matter of months, I’d dropped over 30 pounds. Some of that weight had crept back over the last 10 years in Texas (in large part because of the extreme heat, lack of sidewalks, and places to exercise outside), but last year I finally got back down to my grad school weight that I hadn’t seen since 2006.<br /><br />The gorgeous photography (which Bonnie also shot) and easy-to-read font make this easy to cook from; number of servings can be found on the upper-left-hand side, with a full-color photo for each recipe appearing to the right. There are lots of international influences to keep dinner interesting, from Moroccan-inspired tagines to Greek chicken with eggplant and onion, Thai red curry with roasted kabocha squash and shrimp, pork tenderloin medallions with rosemary marinade, and pasta dishes. Each recipe comes with a brief introduction from Bonnie with additional tips, tricks, and info about specific ingredients. Although the recipes rely on shortcuts (TJ’s frozen veggies, sauces, etc), there are minimal highly-processed ingredients. Because of this, prep times are very reasonable, with many of the main dishes on the table in 30 minutes or less.<br /><br />Whether you’re looking to make a healthier lifestyle change or are simply looking for new ideas for delicious, healthy weeknight meals, “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s” truly has something for everyone!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Longtime vegan Lee Watson works as a vegan chef at a retreat center in Snowdonia National Park, Wales. In “Peace and Parsnips,” he collects 200 of his favorite recipes for smoothies, salads, nibbles, big plates, curries, burgers, desserts and more to prove that vegan food doesn’t have to be limited to spongy tofu and rubber-like nut cutlets. Inspired by his travels to Mexico, Turkish bazaars, Europe, Indian spice markets, and beyond, with minimal fuss and plenty of accessible ingredients he creates delicious meals that even carnivores will appreciate. With an emphasis on seasonality and mindful eating, you’ll find a well-rounded guide to the vegan pantry, including homemade nut milks (soy, cashew, almond, sprouted green lentil), spice blends, sauces and pestos, and even vegan feta that will allow you to create beautiful, healthful dishes that everyone can enjoy (in addition to being vegan, many of the recipes are also gluten-free).<br /><br />Lee includes many international influences in his recipes from Latin America (tostadas with salsa verde, the Middle East (couscous, hummus, tabbouleh, mujaddara, falafel, muhammara), Europe (borscht, filo pie, eggplant involtini, pastas, tempeh chorizo), India (curries, koftas, pulao) and Asia (udon, lumpia, fried rice). You’ll also find a chapter devoted exclusively to “meaty” burgers from Portobello pecan to beet quarter-pounders, spinach bhaji burgers, chickpea, butternut, and apricot burgers, and puy lentil and walnut burgers.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the kasha with rosemary, apricots, and walnuts. My Polish grandmother would frequently fix kasha when I was growing up; I have fond memories of the smell of kasha toasting in the pan before she would add mushrooms or turn it into pier&oacute;g lubelski (buckwheat pie in a pastry crust). I also love all things apricots and walnuts, so was interested to see how this flavor combination would work out. It was an incredibly satisfying combination of crunch (from the walnuts), toothsome buckwheat, and sweet notes from the apricots, plus it freezes well. This may be my new favorite way to serve kasha, and will definitely be going on my lunchtime rotation again soon!<br /><br />The maple and orange-glazed tempeh with bok choy and soba noodles is another winner; I used green tea (matcha) soba as that is what I had on hand, and shimadofu (Okinawan tofu) as tofu is suggested as a possible variation. The beautifully citrus-infused tofu contrasts with the savory soy-based broth (I left out the cilantro as it is not commonly used with noodle dishes here in Japan).<br /><br />I also loved Lee’s stuffed dishes, like the leek and wild mushroom-stuffed potato skins with lemon and chive yogurt, and his many ideas for millet. Although I regularly cook with whole grains, millet is new to me, and I loved the idea of using it as a filling for chard leaves (beet, millet, and raisin-stuffed ruby chard bundles with brazil nut and rosemary cream).<br /><br />Here are two recipes to whet your appetite:<br /><br />Pappardelle with Artichoke & Almond Sauce, Purple Kale & White Asparagus<br /><br /> This dish is a delight! So many shades of green, all bursting with flavor and nutrition. Artichokes make a surprisingly creamy pur&eacute;e. Throw a few almonds into the mix and you’re well on your way to deliciousness. In Spain, I buy fresh artichokes for pennies – pounds of the things are piled around our small kitchen and it can be difficult to know what to do with them. However, I recommend using high-quality jarred artichokes here. In this dish I tend to use white asparagus, but in autumn and winter I’d try to seek out some salsify. It’s a rich root vegetable, perfect with this tangy sauce.<br /><br />Gluten-free option: use GF pasta.<br /><br />For 4<br /><br />THE BITS<br /><br />14 ounces (400g) purple kale, stalks removed, thickly chopped<br />8–10 white asparagus spears<br />2 teaspoons olive oil<br />1/3 cup (75ml) nice white wine (vegan)<br />sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />14 ounces (400g) pappardelle (or similar egg-free pasta)<br />For the artichoke & almond sauce<br /><br />5 tablespoons olive oil<br />a handful of almonds, soaked for 2 hours, skins removed if you have time<br />2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed<br />4 big handfuls of watercress leaves<br />14 ounces (390g) artichoke hearts<br />juice of ½ a lemon<br />For the topping<br /><br />a small handful of toasted almonds, finely chopped<br />a big handful of fresh parsley, chopped<br />a handful of watercress<br /><br />DO IT<br /><br />To make the sauce, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and add the almonds. Saut&eacute; for 1 minute, then add the garlic and continue cooking for 2 minutes more. Add the watercress leaves, cover the pan, remove from the heat and allow to cool.<br /><br />Place the contents of the frying pan in a food processor with the artichokes, lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and blend to a smooth pur&eacute;e. The sauce should be thick and shiny. Add water to thin it out if necessary.<br /><br />Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed frying pan on medium and add the asparagus. Panfry for 6–8 minutes, until nicely caramelized. Add a glug of white wine, and when the liquid has evaporated, season and cover. Leave to sit.<br /><br />Bring a big pan of salted water to a boil and cook your pasta for roughly 8 minutes, until al dente. Add the kale halfway through the cooking time. Drain well, keeping aside a little of the pasta water. Add the drained pasta and kale to the artichoke sauce and toss together, adding some of the pasta water if it is looking a bit dry.<br /><br />Spoon into warm shallow bowls and top with criss-crosses of asparagus and a sprinkling of toasted almonds and parsley. Garnish with the watercress and season with sea salt and black pepper.<br /><br />Recipe from Peace & Parsnips: Adventurous Vegan Cooking For Everyone © Lee Watson, 2016.

Hardly any more trouble than the standard, but the simple flavors knock your socks clean off! You can use any mushrooms here, but the wilder and more intense in flavor, the better.<br /><br />For 4<br /><br />THE BITS<br /><br />4 large baking potatoes<br />2–3 tablespoons olive oil<br />1 leek, finely sliced, green parts included<br />4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed<br />1 small head of broccoli, florets and stems finely diced<br />10½ ounces (300g) wild mushrooms of your choice, roughly chopped<br />½ teaspoon dried rosemary<br />½ teaspoon dried sage<br />1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 2 teaspoons mixed herbs instead of the previous three)<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br />1/3 cup (75ml) almond milk or soy milk<br />a big handful of toasted sunflower seeds<br />2 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes<br />2 tablespoons whole grain mustard<br />For the lemon & chive yogurt<br /><br />a handful of fresh chives, finely chopped<br />1¼ cups (300ml) unsweetened soy yogurt<br />1 tablespoon lemon juice<br />½ tablespoon lemon zest<br />a large pinch of sea salt<br />DO IT<br /><br />Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).<br /><br />Prick the potatoes all over with a fork and rub them with oil. Bake for 1¼ hours, until golden and soft, turning them over once during that time. Cut them in half and leave to cool.<br /><br />Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan on medium and saut&eacute; your leeks for 6 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, broccoli and mushrooms and cook for another 5 minutes. Pop in the dried herbs, stir and season, then remove from the heat and cover.<br /><br />The potatoes should now be cool enough to handle. Carefully scoop out the insides and put them into a bowl, leaving the crispy skins intact. These will be our stuffing vessels! Mash the insides with the milk, then stir in the vegetables, seeds, nutritional yeast flakes and mustard, adding a little more salt as needed. Spoon the mash back into the waiting skins, packing them full to bursting, and place them on an oiled baking tray. Pop the potatoes back into the oven for 10–15 minutes, until piping hot.<br /><br />To make the lemon and chive yogurt, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl.<br /><br />Serve the stuffed potato skins with a good dollop of lemon and chive yogurt on the side.<br /><br />Recipe from Peace & Parsnips: Adventurous Vegan Cooking For Everyone © Lee Watson, 2016. Reprinted by permission of the publisher, The Experiment. Available wherever books are sold.  theexperimentpublishing.com<br /><br />Along the way, gorgeous photographs by Alistair Richardson on matte pages (which makes it MUCH easier to cook from) makes for an attractive presentation, and I appreciated that both the metric and US measurements are listed (many times when books are adapted for the US market, the metric measurements are left out, but I prefer to cook in metric if that’s how the book was written / tested). I also appreciate that unlike many vegan cookbooks, Lee avoids the heavily processed soy meat and cheese/dairy analogs (faux chick’n nuggets, ground “beef,” soy “cheese,” etc.) in favor of tempeh, tofu, or homemade alternatives.<br /><br />Whether you’re a longtime vegan, a transitioning vegan, or simply someone who appreciates good food and is looking for healthy and delicious weeknight meals, “Peace and Parsnips” deserves a spot on your shelf!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of my friends at The Experiment)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France, Italy, Mexico, Israel, and North America, you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs, lasagna bolognaise, and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).<br /><br />I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”), but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.<br /><br />The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes, including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto),  ravioli, Tuscan bean and farro soup, veal scallopini, brachiole, (fried) pizza Napolitana, ragu Napolitano, and lasagna, but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs, spicy kim chee hangar steaks,  ramen, chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas, ceviche, and pulled beef tacos.<br /><br />The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light, refreshing salads for nearly every meal, and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot, hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad, Lumina market salad, Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!), kale squash Caesar salad, root vegetable apple salad, and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes, haricots verts, and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy, you can add crumbled feta while warm).<br /><br />Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken, Amalfi sage chicken, and mustard caper chicken, and the meat dishes include various roasts, grills, and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall, while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding, farroto, pasta frittata, and risotto, while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon, layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka; having taught many students from Georgia, I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping; save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.<br /><br />Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter, including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo), tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before), sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce, chestnut tomato quinoa, and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu, Beresheet Spa Kanafe, banana, date, and pecan cake, almond bobka ring, halvah baklava, and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder.<br />Recipes are clearly labeled as meat, dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus, seviche for ceviche, bobka for babka, etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons, turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze, and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces), but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart, fish dishes, and veggie sides).<br /><br />Overall, “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500,000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen; Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions, from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day, in Susie’s words, “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”<br /><br />(Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'title': '\"Pomegranates and Saffron\"',\n",
       "  'text': 'Nearly ten years ago to the day, I embarked on my present career as an adult EFL / ESL instructor. Freshly minted from grad school with my MA TESOL in hand, I began teaching English to students from over 100 countries, some of which I didn’t even know existed (particularly the Caucasus and Central Asia, as we never really studied world geography much in school). My very first ESL class included a lovely captain from Azerbaijan (who, coincidentally, I ran into again last year as a repeat student and we recognized each other instantly!). One of my favorite aspects of my job is the cultural exchange; I’ve learned about traditional Kyrgyz music and clothing, Mongolia’s nomadic culture, Afghan cuisine, Saudi Arabia’s oral poetry tradition (another student was a finalist on Saudi Arabia’s televised poetry competition “Million’s Poet”), Taiwanese holidays,  Georgian winemaking, and Azerbaijan’s rich cultural heritage and culinary delights. Several of my colleagues spent six months teaching in Baku, and I was fascinated by the colorful embroidery, photos and stories they brought back.<br /><br />So imagine my delight when I learned of Feride Buyuran’s “Pomegranates and Saffron,” which won the prestigious Gourmand’s “Best In The World” title in 2015 along with several other major awards. I have hundreds of cookbooks on international cuisine, but had never really explored Azerbaijani cuisine before. Due to its geographic location, Azerbaijan’s foodways unsurprisingly include influences from neighboring Iran, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia and Russia. This has resulted in a vibrant, colorful cuisine that combines the best of all these cultures: cooling yogurt soups, meltingly tender kebabs, stuffed grape leaves and vegetables, jeweled saffron plovs (pilafs) piled high and gleaming like a king’s ransom, and silky rice puddings, delicate almond cookies and syrup-soaked desserts. I also loved the addition of entire chapters devoted to pickled vegetables (turshu) and preserves, a common fixture on the Azerbaijani table.<br /><br />Feride immigrated to the US about 15 years ago; interested in recipes from a young age, she began to recreate the tastes she missed from home, and the seeds for “Pomegranates and Saffron” were sown. Feride and her family take trips back to Azerbaijan every few years, where she has the chance to travel the country trying regional specialties and documenting Azerbaijan’s food culture. The final book is the result of more than six years spent researching, testing, traveling and photographing dishes and everyday life across Azerbaijan, and this labor of love shines through on every gorgeous glossy page.<br /><br />“Pomegranates and Saffron” contains 200 diverse recipes for appetizers and salads, soups and stews, pasta, meat, vegetable and egg dishes, breads, pilafs, drinks, and desserts, all adapted with Western kitchens in mind. The book opens with an introduction that includes an overview of Azerbaijan’s legendary hospitality, holidays (particularly Novruz), and food traditions, then plunges into appetizers. Here there are many similarities to Persian cuisine, including the heavy use of fresh herbs and many lovely vegetable salads and relishes (eggplant “caviar,” garlicky eggplant dip, and salad Olivier (the “Capital Salad,” which I first discovered in Spain as an exchange student in 2002). I love nothing better than to make an entire meal by creating a spread of several appetizers with freshly baked bread, particularly during the hot, hazy days of summer.<br /><br />Azerbaijan’s soups vary depending on the season; in the colder winter months, people seek solace in heartier pasta soups and stews like dushbere, khemirashi and mash shorbasi, while in summer light and refreshing yogurt soups are served, including doghramaj and dovgha. Lamb, beef, and poultry dishes are sure to delight with various kebabs and stews (including a variation of fesenjoon), while fish preparations are delightfully fresh and uncomplicated (salmon kebabs, pan-fried fish patties, fish stuffed with fresh herbs). Vegetarians will relish the kukus (egg and vegetable omelettes), fried, grilled and baked vegetables, and pasta dishes. As I am primarily a baker, I particularly enjoyed the chapter on breads and pastries, including the shorgoghal, decorated flaky bread, walnut and onion and bean and potato breads, and tendir bread (which, like Georgia, is essentially a tandoor oven).<br /><br />Over the past couple of months, I’ve tried making several of the recipes in “Pomegranates and Saffron,” including the dill and fava bean pilaf (fava beans are in season here), yogurt soup, and half-moon dumplings with a butternut squash filling. The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out and easy to follow; for more complicated recipes, the step-by-step photos were invaluable. I loved the dumpling filling in particular (I used kabocha with ground walnuts and cinnamon) and am experimenting with using it in other dishes. As it was my first try making tahdig (the golden, crispy rice crust on the bottom of the pot, my results were not picture-perfect but the flavor and texture were indescribable; I can now see why families fight over who gets the crispy goodness at the bottom of the pot! And I first boiled then pan-fried the dumplings in butter, which is how my Polish grandmother always made pierogi.<br /><br />I loved learning about Azerbaijani kitchen tools such as the saj grill, traditional pasta boards, and terra cotta bread stamps. As a linguist and keen student of culture, I also loved that nearly every recipe comes with an Azerbaijani food proverb (“Words of Wisdom”) in Azeri and English (Azeri is closely related to Turkish). I particularly loved the food proverbs as one of the assignments I always give my international students is to teach the rest of the class a proverb from their country, then see if there is a similar one in English; the next time I have students from Azerbaijan, I have many new proverbs to ask them about!<br /><br />Each recipe is illustrated with a beautiful full-color photograph (some step by step) that showcases beautiful Azeri embroidery, place settings and tools. Each recipe intro and chapter heading gives further information into Azeri culture and food traditions, especially regional ones. A detailed bibliography and additional resources into culture, language, and literature and folklore are also provided.<br /><br />“Pomegranates and Saffron” is a gorgeous cookbook that deserves every award it is up for; the stunning photography, rich cultural background, and the physical book itself (oversized, with a red satin bookmark) will immerse you in the sights and smells of Azerbaijan’s rich culinary history. The book is available through Feride’s website, which also includes a wealth of cultural info on Azerbaijan, online shopping, and the recipes featured in the book plus more.',\n",

       "  'text': \"While living in Spain as an exchange student in 2002, I discovered the rich legacy of Spain’s Jews, the Sephardim, who, after expulsion in 1492, resettled in Turkey, Greece, Morocco, and North Africa (most recently Israel and the United States), taking with them their rich language (Ladino) and cuisine. This living history can be directly traced back to the 1400s, both through the names of dishes (which are recognizable to any Spanish speaker) and the dishes themselves, found throughout dozens of countries where Sephardic Jews immigrated. These include filled pastries such as borekas, boyuz (“bollos” in modern Spanish), bumuelos (bimuelos) as well as desserts. During my second time living in Spain in 2005 (Madrid), I made a point of visiting Toledo and Spain’s Jewish quarters, synagogues and museums, where I fell in love with Sephardic culture. I spent the next several years building up my cookbook library of Sephardic titles (particularly by the excellent and prolific Joyce Goldstein), but was lacking in Sephardic baking books in English (although I do have the excellent Spanish-language [[ASIN:8427032374 Dulce lo vivas/ Live Sweet: La Reposteria Sefardi/ the Sefardi Bakery (Spanish Edition)]]).<br /><br />I was thrilled to learn of Linda Capeloto Sendowski’s “Sephardic Baking From Nona and More Favorites.” Linda’s nona (grandmother) immigrated from Turkey to Seattle (there is a very large Sephardic congregation there where Ladino is still spoken). Linda’s father is a Rhodesli (Sephardic Jews who settled on the Greek island of Rhodes; the community was nearly wiped out in the Holocaust. An excellent book on Rhodesli cooking is [[ASIN:1919939679 Stella's Sephardic Table: Jewish family recipes from the Mediterranean island of Rhodes]] that documents pre-war life in Rhodes).<br /><br />You can find Linda’s recipes and more family stories at her website The Global Jewish Kitchen and The Boreka Diaries. The book is available as a paperback (printed in the USA; it’s a lovely large oversized volume that sits well in a cookbook holder) or Kindle book; if you’re a member of Kindle Unlimited, you can download it for free, although I recommend purchasing the paperback as it is much easier to bookmark recipes and to cook from (I have both formats).<br /><br />Beginning with her family’s challah recipe, you’ll also find raisin and saffron challah, pumpkin challah (one of my favorites to make with leftover canned pumpkin), amazing cinnamon-apple rolls, and pumpkin-cranberry cinnamon rolls (be still my heart!). All of these freeze well, so you can enjoy some now and save some for later (or share with lucky neighbors / coworkers, in my case!).<br /><br />On to desayuno: I’d read of the Sephardic tradition of desayuno (“breakfast,”), baked goods served on the Sabbath, but had never seen or attempted recipes for these before. They include borekas with cheese and potatoes, bulemas with Swiss chard, folares (which are symbolic on Purim as they symbolize Haman’s hanging noose), and kezadas (rice-and-cheese pies, the ultimate comfort food!). Several recipes for meat and pareve pies are also included; I loved the pumpkin borekas and rodanchas as I can never get enough of pumpkin-filled pastries during any time of the year.<br />Sephardic sweets include a nondairy baklava, kurabiedes (Greek nut cookies similar to Russian tea cakes), ma’amoul (date-filled shortbread cookies; my first experience was when an Iraqi student made some for me), and an entire chapter of “things to dunk in coffee,” such as cantucci (which I first tasted in Tuscany), biscotios de huevo, and biscotti. You’ll also find cheesecake, stuffed pastries (strudels, tarts), a showstopper chocolate espresso  cake, honey cake (typical of the High Holidays), and a lovely pistachio pear yogurt cake for Shavuot. Linda also includes several base recipes such as blood orange marmalade, candied grapefruit peels, and ganache. Many recipes come with gorgeous full-color photos, and a handy glossary explains common Ladino names and Jewish holidays.<br /><br />Linda was kind enough to share two of her favorite recipes and photos; I am reprinting them below with her permission:<br /><br />Pastelicos<br />A Meat and Rice Filled Sephardic Pastry<br />“A Pastel is a hand pie in Ladino or Judeo Spanish, and these individual small ‘pies’ use the suffix indicating smallness. Think of Pastelicos as a meat and rice filled Boreka that comes in different shapes. Other Sephardim make similar things such as meat Sambusak.  Rather than half moon shapes as for Cheese Borekas, Pastelicos are triangle shape or round with little caps.<br /><br />Be sure and count more than one per person when planning how many to serve.  The filling amount in this recipe is for two batches of dough.  Make dough recipe twice.  Make one recipe, fill and bake pastelicos and then, make second dough recipe to finish using filling.  Filling (gomo) is best made the night before and refrigerated.”<br /><br />Yield: about 90 Pastelicos<br /><br />Filling:<br />2 tablespoons oil<br />2 large onions, finely chopped<br />1 to 2 teaspoons salt<br />Freshly ground pepper<br />2 pounds ground beef chuck meat<br />1 cup washed and patted dry, finely chopped fresh parsley<br />1/3 cup long grain white rice<br />Dough:  (make this twice)<br />4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />1 cup ice water<br />3/4 cup safflower oil<br />Topping:<br /> 1 large egg, beaten<br />1/ 2 cup sesame seeds (regular white not toasted)<br />Heat a large saut&eacute; pan until hot over medium heat.  Add oil to pan, heat for a moment, and then add onions.  Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon, saut&eacute;ing until golden.  Season onions with salt, pepper to taste.  Push onions aside in pan, turn up heat to high, add ground chuck and saut&eacute; until browned and starting to stick.  As you stir onions and chuck meat, break meat up with your spoons so it becomes crumbly with no large chunks of ground meat intact.  Adjust seasoning if needed.<br /><br />Stir parsley and rice into meat mixture.  Stir meat mixture for a moment.  Add<br />1 cup water to cover meat and rice; cover pan.  Reduce heat to low, and let steam until water is absorbed and rice is cooked, about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool filling before using.  Refrigerate overnight in a covered bowl.<br /><br />Place flour in a medium bowl and add salt.  In a two-cup glass measuring cup, whisk together ice water and oil to emulsify.  Slowly pour liquid into flour, stirring with a fork.  When dough holds together, use your hands to gather dough into a ball.  Dough should be soft and pliable.<br /><br />Divide dough into 42 to 48 walnut-size pieces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a smooth ball. When all are rolled, use a rolling pin, and roll each ball into a circle, no larger than 3-inches in diameter, taking care not to go over edges with the rolling pin making them too thin.<br />Heat oven to 400° F.  Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with silpats or parchment paper.  Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in each circle.  Close filled circles by folding dough in a triangle shape or pinching edges into a triangle with a rope edge (repulgo).  Place Pastelicos on baking sheets.  Brush all Pastelicos with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake until golden and crispy, about 15 to 17 minutes. Repeat with second batch of dough to use remainder of filling.  Yield is 84-92 Pastelicos.<br /><br />After Pastelicos cool, they keep well for two days in refrigerator or freeze them in airtight containers.  Reheat in a 300° F oven for 10 to15 minutes to recrisp.<br /><br /> Some communities add additional flavorings to their Pastelicos, my Nona like lots of black pepper and parsley but you could try, cinnamon, allspice, Baharat, or cumin.<br /><br />Biscotio<br />Sephardic Tea Biscuits, Biscotios de Huevo<br />“The first generation of my family in America—my grandmothers and great aunties–came from Turkey. The women used to sit and rest a bit in the afternoon after preparing dinner and finishing their housework. They traded bits of gossip about the community and themselves (char lashon) with a cup of Turkish coffee (kave Turko) and a biscuit (biscotio) in hand. These circular biscuits topped with sesame seeds are not sweet like cookies nor are they savory. They are perfect for dunking in coffee, espresso, or even tea. Biscotios keep a long time in an airtight container and are very portable. It is good to keep several in a small plastic bag in the bottom of your handbag, just in case. (I guess we all turn into our mothers or fathers eventually!)”<br /><br />Yield: 80 biscotios<br />Dough:<br />4 extra large eggs<br />1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice<br />1 cup sugar<br />3/4 cup oil<br />6 cups flour<br />1 and 1/2 teaspoon ground anise<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />4 teaspoons baking powder<br />1/2 teaspoon salt<br />2 tablespoons freshly grated orange peel<br />Topping:<br />1 egg, well beaten, in a shallow bowl<br />1 cup sesame seeds, in a shallow bowl<br />Crack eggs into a small glass bowl and check for shells and blood spots. Place eggs in mixing bowl of stand mixer and beat at medium speed for one minute. Add orange juice and beat until well blended. With mixer running on low speed, slowly add sugar, then oil. Turn up speed to medium and continue mixing until well blended.<br /><br />In a separate bowl combine flour with other dry ingredients and orange peel. Add one-half of flour mixture to liquid mixture while mixer is turned off. Start mixer on lowest speed for 30 seconds, then raise speed to medium and mix until flour is well incorporated. Turn off mixer and add remaining flour. Start mixer on lowest speed until flour begins to incorporate; increase speed to medium for several moments. Dough should be soft but not sticky.<br /><br />Remove dough from mixing bowl, gather it into a ball, and let dough rest for 10 minutes on work surface.<br />Heat oven to 350⁰F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.<br /><br />Divide dough into 4 quarters. Wrap 3 pieces in plastic wrap. On a lightly floured work surface roll remaining piece of dough into a log about 1 and 1/2 inches in diameter. Cut log in 20 even pieces. Roll each piece out to a 4-inch long rope. Use a small knife to nick rope on outer edge at 1/3-inch intervals, creating a design. Draw rope into a circle and pinch edges together nicked side out.<br />Arrange bowls with beaten egg and sesame seeds next to cookie sheets. Dip one side of each biscotio into beaten egg, then sesame seed, and place on prepared baking sheet, sesame side up.<br /><br />Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden in color. After all biscotios are baked, turn oven down to 200⁰ F. Return biscotios to oven.  Turn off oven after 30 minutes and leave biscotios in oven for two hours to crisp or overnight with oven door closed. Cool biscotios on a rack and store in an airtight container.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed learning about the author’s family history and the Sephardic community in Seattle (I’ve done a fair amount of research on Ladino and had run across this story several years ago). This is a beautiful tribute to a rich culinary tradition, and Linda’s gorgeous full-color photography will inspire you to bake your way through it. Although I was familiar with some of the Sephardic baked goods like borekas, others like the gorgeous kezadas were new to me, and I loved the additional European baked goods like pissaladiere and strudel. There is truly something for everyone in “Sephardic Baking” no matter your baking expertise; the clear instructions and photos ensure that even novice bakers will produce fabulous baked goods.<br /><br />In Linda’s words, “Eat Well, Enjoy Life!”<br /><br />(Thank you to Linda for the signed review copy and included recipes and photos!)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'An accomplished writer and artist, Linda Dalal Sawaya’s family immigrated from Douma, Lebanon to Detroit in 1926; her grandmother Dalal and mother Alice Ganamey Sawaya, mother of five, grandmother of seven, great-grandmother of nine, soon became famous for their cooking, and as the youngest of five daughters, Linda later became their kitchen assistant. In “Alice’s Kitchen” (now in its fourth edition), Linda lovingly collects family portraits, memories, and over 100 traditional Lebanese dishes including mezza, salads, kebabs, stuffed veggies, and delicate desserts that capture the essence of Lebanon’s healthful, veggie-centric cuisine in a simple, easily approachable format. In addition, a portion of the proceeds benefits the children of Lebanon.<br /><br />Linda, her artwork, and “Alice’s Kitchen” were featured prominently in an issue of the excellent magazine “Aramco World,” and Linda was kind enough to send a copy of the issue “Memories of a Lebanese Garden,” which features stunning cover paintings of the author and her mother in a garden filled with classic Lebanese imagery and produce as well as full-page paintings of scenes from Douma, the author learning to toss bread in the air like her mother and grandmother before her, family portraits, and illustrated ingredients for the featured recipes (‘ihjee, sambusak, mujaddrah, kusah mahshi, salatat bandurah Elis).<br /><br />Linda’s grandmother Dalal had lived through WWI, rationing, single parenting and a historic earthquake before joining her husband in Detroit; having survived these hardships, she taught her children and grandchildren the art of recycling, conversation and not wasting even a single grain of rice. Moving to the US meant that new culinary skills had to be learned – where the town butcher in Douma had previously prepared various cuts of lamb, this was a luxury not available in 1950s Los Angeles, so Alice and Dalal learned to cut legs of lamb for various dishes, and how to bake their own bread (huge, paper-thin loaves). Linda grew up surrounded by an abundance of food, prepared not only for the family but also any visitors that happened to drop by, a hallmark of Lebanese hospitality. Her family kept a small kitchen garden where they grew mint, purslane, squash, grape leaves, and figs.<br /><br />Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Alice, I feel as though I know her through reading Linda’s stories and through the black and white photographs; my own grandmother was named Alice and also immigrated to Michigan (in my case, from Poland in 1913). She similarly preserved and passed down her heritage through her love of cooking and feeding family, so “Alice’s Kitchen” resonated deeply with me on many levels far beyond a simple culinary connection. As a child, I remember my grandmother recounting arriving at Ellis Island; when I finally made it to Ellis Island in 1914 during a job interview in NYC, it was a highly charged emotional moment to see it from the ferry for the first time, just as my grandmother must have seen it. Now as an adult, I am attempting to reconnect with my immigrant heritage by trying to recapture the taste of my grandmother’s home cooking. (Unlike Linda, I was not fortunate enough to preserve my grandmother’s recipes or to learn from her in the kitchen while she was still alive).<br /><br />Having grown up surrounded by her family’s Lebanese cuisine in Los Angeles, Linda had the chance to finally experience Lebanon’s culture and legendary hospitality for herself during a three-month sojourn in 1971. Suddenly familiar rituals and flavors that she’d taken for granted took on new meaning; the artistry that her mother Alice incorporated was evident in every dish. This first encounter with Lebanon transformed her life and provided the starting point for “Alice’s Kitchen.”<br /><br />Opening with a very helpful guide to “About the Recipes,” you’ll find a section on curing olives and pickling (green, black, pickled turnips and vegetables), homemade cheese, yogurt and butter (including Arabic cheese, labne, and clarified butter), sauces (yogurt garlic, tahini, za’atar with olive oil). Salads are probably my favorite part of Lebanese cuisine, and you’ll find familiar favorites like fattoush and tabbouli alongside Salatat Elias (tomato salad with garlic and spearmint), yogurt and cucumber, and Lebanese potato salad.<br /><br />As lamb is a central component to many Lebanese dishes, there is an excellent illustrated guide to breaking down various cuts (leg, breast, shoulder) and many excellent serving suggestions (shish kebab, grilled ground lamb, meat pies, and the national dish, kibbe nayye (raw minced lamb and bulgur). Chicken and fish dishes will give you additional ideas for mains.<br /><br />Being vegetarian, of course my favorite section was vegetarian entrees and vegetables, beans, and grains. Lebanese cuisine lends itself particularly well to vegetarian dishes such as mjaddrah (lentils and rice with caramelized onions, fatayir (spinach pies), ‘ijjeh (omelette with parsley, mint and onion), summer squash stuffed with rice, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, falafel and vegetarian kibbe. As a fan of both pumpkin and bulgur, the kibbet jlunt (baked pumpkin and bulgur with pine nuts) was a revelation. Her version of Mhammara (grilled red pepper and walnut dip) is superb; just the right degree of tart (from lemon juice and pomegranate molasses) with a little kick from the chili paste (I used Tunisian harissa), this addictive dip goes perfectly with veggies, pita, feta, and basically anything you can think of! And you’ll find the full range of wonderful Middle Eastern desserts, from walnut ma’amoul, ‘atayif (crepes with cheese or walnut filling), knafe, a delicately spiced rice pudding, and baklava rounded out with suggested drinks. There’s even a section on homemade preserves and fruit leathers (fig jam with aniseed and walnuts, quince, apricot, and pumpkin and carrot infused with rose geranium petals.<br /><br />Recipe names are given in transliterated Arabic as well as English (Arabic titles are listed in italics in the index). Each recipe is introduced with a brief background into the dish, its importance in traditional Lebanese cuisine or preparation and serving tips, and family stories and traditions. A handy glossary breaks down Arabic terms for cooking, tools, ingredients, terms of endearments and hospitality, and sample menus for breakfast, lunch, mezza, dinner, and more.<br /><br />Here is Linda’s fabulous recipe for Mhammara:<br /><br />3 red bell peppers, roasted or grilled until blackened (I used one jar drained roasted red peppers)<br />1 cup walnuts<br />1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses<br />1 tablespoon chili paste (I used harissa)<br />3 cloves of garlic<br />2 tablespoons lemon juice<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional – I skipped it)<br />2 tablespoons sesame seeds (I used toasted)<br />2 tablespoons bread crumbs (or more as needed)<br /><br />1. Place whole red peppers over a grill, or broil until blackened. This takes only a few minutes. Put hot peppers into a paper bag and close to cool. This makes them easy to peel. Under running water, remove all the blackened skin. Cut in half and remove seeds. Juices from the peppers can be used in the dip.<br />2. Put peppers and all of the remaining ingredients into a food processor and pulse just until the consistency is minced but not pureed.<br />3. Taste and add seasonings or bread crumbs as needed. Serve with Arabic bread, pita chips, or crackers.<br />Makes 2 cups of dip, serving 8 to 10 for appetizers.<br /><br />Overall, Alice’s Kitchen is a book I will be turning to again and again to make the most of summer’s bounty through simple, delicious recipes that preserve the unique flavors of the fruits and veggies that star in them.<br /><br />As Linda so eloquently puts it, the appeal of traditional Lebanese cuisine is that “Our tradition is about living gently on the earth. Using resources of the earth respectfully. Sharing and preparing food with love. Eating what is in season. Growing our own food as much as possible. Living simply and richly. Honoring the earth. Honoring ourselves and each other. This is my gesture to honor and preserve that culture for myself, for my family, and for others who appreciate these traditions, values, and foods.” As Linda’s mother Alice described it, “Dear, if you make it with love, it will be delicious.” Sallem dayetkoom!<br /><br />(A heartfelt shukran (thank you) to Linda for the review copy of Alice’s Kitchen, postcard featuring her original oil paintings, and copy of the January / February 1997 Aramco World magazine she was the cover story on.)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Make mornings sweet!',\n",
       "  'text': 'Mornings have always been my favorite time of the day – sitting down enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee and a freshly baked treat as the sun streams across the kitchen table is the perfect way to start the day. I have and cherish both of Patty Pinner’s memoir cookbooks, [[ASIN:1580087981 Sweets: Soul Food Desserts and Memories]] and [[ASIN:1561588482 Sweety Pies: An Uncommon Collection of Womanish Observations, with Pie]], and was excited to see that she had a new cookbook coming out that focused on breakfast and brunch recipes. Patty, a fellow native of Michigan, collected wonderful soul food recipes and stories in her two previous cookbooks, and “Sweet Mornings” is no exception. Each of the 125 recipes is peppered with memories of friends, family and neighbors in Michigan, visiting family in Tennessee, and the larger-than-life personalities of the strong women that surrounded her: neighbors with flashy tastes in dresses, mink coats, and handbags who could turn out sumptuous feasts, others who gave sound advice to young wives, strong matriarchs who expressed their love through sugar and butter, and the world viewed through the more innocent lens of childhood.<br /><br />No matter your favorite breakfast vice (biscuits, quick breads, pancakes, muffins, bars, waffles, cinnamon rolls, French toast), all are amply represented in the 125 recipes. I loved that some fall into the quick and easy category (including a handful that use pie filling or pudding mix, such as the pistachio coffee cake and Ava Joy’s Lemon Streusel), while others like the orange-filled rolls are perfect for more leisurely mornings. Although most of the book is devoted to baked goods, you’ll also find more substantial brunch offerings including chicken and waffles, chicken salad, hash browns, steak and eggs.<br /><br />I inherited several recipes from my Polish grandmother, who was a talented baker; one of my favorites is her sour cream coffeecake, so I was thrilled to see nearly two dozen variations in “Sweet Mornings” ranging from the traditional (old-fashioned sour cream, which is closest to what my babcia made) to coffeecakes punched up with citrus (Lemon Drizzle and Ava Joy’s Lemon Streusel), chocolate, fruit-filled, and more. I tried the Mama’s Strawberry Coffee Cake first as strawberries are in season here in Japan; for this recipe, I used the smallest, sweetest strawberries I could find. Two cups of strawberries may sound like a lot – indeed, I had trouble chopping my strawberries into uniform pieces as they were so ripe, they fairly dissolved into puddles of juicy sweetness as I cut, but the final result is a layer of no-fuss strawberry jam. The layer of strawberries was a delightful variation and one I look forward to making frequently as it freezes well. One note about the recipe below is that I had to modify the instructions; the ingredient amounts for the butter in the batter and the topping are reversed (the instructions call for you to cream 2 Tbsp melted butter with the sugar, but from years of baking experience I knew to reverse the amounts and cream the one stick softened butter with the sugar, reserving the melted butter for the streusel topping).<br /><br />Mama’s Strawberry Coffee Cake (recipe adapted from “Sweet Mornings”)<br />(Makes 1 9-inch square coffee cake)<br />Batter:<br />Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing (I use Baker’s Joy)<br />1 ½ cups all-purpose flour<br />1 teaspoon baking powder<br />1 teaspoon baking soda<br />½ teaspoon salt<br />½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br />½ cup granulated sugar<br />1 large egg, room temperature<br />½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />½ cup half-and-half, room temperature<br />2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and chopped<br /><br />Topping:<br />½ cups all-purpose flour<br />½ cup granulated sugar<br />½ cup chopped walnuts<br />2 Tablespoons melted butter<br />½ teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with the cooking spray and set aside.<br />2. To make the batter: In a large mixing bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.<br />3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, break up the butter by mixing on low speed for 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar and cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed for 2 to 4 minutes, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent large lumps from forming. As the mixer is running, reduce the speed to low and add the egg, making sure that it is thoroughly incorporated into the mixture. Add the vanilla extract and beat until combined. (Do not overbeat.) Turn off the mixer.<br />4. Set the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture and the half-and-half to the bowl of the mixer in alternating thirds, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Continue beating until the mixture is just moistened. (Do not overbeat).<br />5. To make the topping: in a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, walnuts, butter and cinnamon, and using your hands, stir until well blended (I found I needed a little extra melted butter to get the consistency I was looking for).<br />6. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish and arrange the strawberries evenly on top of the batter. Evenly sprinkle the topping on top of the strawberries. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool in the baking dish on a wire rack and allow to cool completely.<br />7. Turn out the cake, slice and transfer to a serving platter. Serve at room temperature.<br />The second coffee cake I tried was the Apricot Coffee Bread. I love all things dried apricot, and this coffee bread (really more of a pound cake) was no exception. Rich with butter and sour cream, the cake is studded with beautiful cubes of apricot and toasted pecans. Be sure to chop your apricots into small uniform pieces for best appearance. Again, I found I had to make a small adjustment to the recipe as it does not specify when to add the flour mixture to the batter; after adding the eggs and sour cream, you’re instructed to stir in apricots and pecans and bake. I decided to add the flour in three additions on low speed after incorporating the sour cream (which I had first mixed with vanilla bean paste), then stirred in the apricots and pecans by hand rather than mixer. The amount of streusel seems like a lot, but this is a large cake, so use the whole amount; I found I had to take the cake out a couple of times during baking to sprinkle more topping around the edges of the pan where plain batter was pushing up. The topping also browned quickly towards the last 20 minutes of baking, so I covered with foil to prevent it from overbrowning.<br />One consideration is that you are instructed to bake in a tube or Bundt pan, but the bread has a topping, meaning that you will have to invert the bread onto a plate, flip, and put right-side-up to cool to keep the topping crunchy (the bread is equally beautiful if you leave it topping-side-down like a traditional Bundt; that way, the apricots look like bits of stained glass). The instructions also call to dust with powdered sugar, so if you prefer to make it as a traditional Bundt, you can skip the topping and dust the finished bread with powdered sugar instead. As I collect Bundt pans (hence my moniker of “Bundt Lust&#34;), I used my 10-15 cup anniversary Bundt and this cake nearly came to the top, so use a sizeable pan.<br /><br />Apricot Coffee Bread (adapted from “Sweet Mornings”)<br />Makes 1 10-inch tube or Bundt bread<br />Topping:<br />½ cup all-purpose flour<br />½ cup firmly packed brown sugar<br />1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />4 tablespoons butter, cold, cut into small pieces<br /><br />Batter:<br />Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing<br />3 cups all-purpose flour<br />1 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br />½ teaspoon baking soda<br />½ teaspoon salt<br />¾ cup (1 ½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature<br />1 ½ cups granulated sugar<br />3 large eggs, room temperature (warm cold eggs by placing in a bowl of warm water)<br />1 cup sour cream, room temperature<br />1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />1 cup dried apricots, chopped into small pieces<br />½ cup chopped pecans (I toasted them first)<br />Confectioners’ sugar (for garnish)<br />1. To make the topping: In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon and stir until well combined. Using your fingers, a pastry blender, or the tines of a fork, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles small crumbs. Set aside.<br />2. Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 10-inch tube or Bundt pan with Baker’s Joy and set aside.<br />3. To make the batter: In a large mixing bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: the lour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.<br />4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, break up the butter by mixing on low speed for 1 minute. Add the granulated sugar and cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed or 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom owt the bowl to prevent lumps from forming. As the mixer is running, reduce the speed to low and slowly add the eggs, 1 at a time; after you add each egg, scrape down the sides of the bowl and resume eating on low speed for 30 seconds. Add the sour cream and anilla extract (I used vanilla bean paste) and beat at low speed for 30 seconds. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract and beat at low speed for 2 to 3 seconds, until just incorporated.<br />5. Add the flour mixture in three batches, mixing on low just until incorporated. Turn off the mixer.<br />6. Add the apricots and pecans to the batter and stir just until distributed.<br />7. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and evenly sprinkle the top of the batter with the topping. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool on a wire rack.<br />8. Using a silicone spatula, separate the bread from the pan and invert onto the wire rack to cool completely (I let mine cool in the pan; if you decide to turn it out, put a piece of foil under the rack to catch any topping that falls off).<br />9. Transfer to a serving platter and dust with the confectioners’’ sugar. Slice and sere at room temperature.<br />Other recipes that reminded me of my grandmother’s European baked goods included Aunt Zaida’s Almond Coffee Ring and old-fashioned rice pudding squares, a breakfast staple in my house. My grandma used to make a superb nutmeg-topped rice pudding that I later added dried cherries to in place of raisins and as an adult, I use Arborio rice, which Patty also recommends. These familiar dishes transported me back to my childhood when I used to “bake” (read: taste!) alongside my grandmother in her small Michigan kitchen.<br /><br />Next, I made a half recipe of the cherry granola. Growing up in Michigan, I love all things cherry; Patty’s granola is a festive combination of cherries, pecans, coconut, cinnamon, nutmeg and tart cherries. I substituted maple sugar for the brown sugar as I love maple (the recipe also calls for ¼ cup maple syrup). It’s the perfect way to start your morning off with a pop of color when you don’t have the time or energy for a “fancy” breakfast involving lots of cooking. Be sure to keep a close eye on your granola as it bakes as the nuts and coconut are prone to turn from toasted to burned very quickly! There is no comparison between store-bought granola and homemade; I love that you can customize it with nuts and fruits you like, as well as monitor the oil and sugar content (not so with storebought). Kept in an airtight container, it keeps very well and also makes a beautiful gift when packaged in a decorative jar!<br /><br />Verdict: this is a must-have for all bakers; there is enough variety to keep you happily baking for ages and you’re sure to find new ideas to update classic treats, classic soul food (fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles), and “Sweet Mornings” is just as valuable for the many wonderful stories and larger-than-life characters that bring the recipes to vibrant life (baking along to classic 1960s Motown and soul optional but highly recommended!).<br /><br />Thank you to Agate for the review copy and permission to reprint recipes!<br /><br />(This review originally published on Bundt Lust 22 April, 2016)',\n",

       "  'title': 'A fantastic resource for novice and experienced chefs alike',\n",
       "  'text': \"I was vaguely familiar with Sara Moulton from her show on PBS (I'd watched several episodes where she cooked with other chefs I follow, such as Michele Scicolone ([[ASIN:0547744455 The Mediterranean Slow Cooker]]) and Grace Young, but had never cooked from one of her cookbooks before, so I was excited to try out &#34;Home Cooking 101.&#34; A fantastic illustrated guide to pantry staples and step-by-step prep for more complicated dishes, you'll learn essential techniques such as making your own stock, preserved lemon slices, ricotta and paneer, how to bake fish in a parchment bag, how to French a rack of lamb, pounding cutlets and more. Helpful sidebars give additional info and tips and tricks, including herb pairings, how to prepare ingredients, ingredient primers, etc. The numbered step-by-step photos (which get an entire page) are tremendously helpful to learn new techniques such as making spaetzle, crack a coconut, pound cutlets, trimming a rack of lamb, etc.<br /><br />The book includes chapters on soups and salads, meat, poultry, seafood and vegetarian/vegan entrees, side dishes, “quick and quicker” entrees, more labor-intensive dishes for &#34;when you have time,&#34; and desserts (&#34;something sweet&#34;). One thing that took getting used to was the fact that chapter headers do not have tables of contents, so you will have to refer to the index or bookmark using sticky tabs to quickly locate recipes.<br /><br />As I have several years’ experience in publishing (including layout in InDesign), I tend to pay close attention to a book’s layout, and the simple, uncluttered layout here (and effective use of color and fonts; recipe titles and ingredients are listed in teal, while steps are in black) works wonderfully. The font size and spacing make this highly readable even from a cookbook holder; all too often, I’ve reviewed books with too-light print or gloss pages that render them unreadable under actual kitchen conditions.<br /><br />For my first test recipe, I decided to try the salmon baked in a bag. Although I’ve long known of the technique, I’d never tried making it at home; a pity, because know that I know how easy it is, I will certainly be cooking this way more often! You layer thin slices of orange and lemon, sprinkle with rosemary, top with seasoned salmon filets, top with more lemon and orange slices and chopped olives (I used Kalamata since the recommended oil-cured are impossible to find here) and bake; I halved the recipe for two good-sized filets, and it took about 14 minutes. The bonus is that your kitchen doesn’t smell “fishy,” and the fish cooks up perfectly moist, marinated in the citrus juices and a drizzle of olive oil. You could also switch out the orange slices for blood orange and use Meyer lemons; the possibilities are endless! Cleanup is a breeze; simply open the parchment bag, use a spatula to transfer the fish and citrus to a serving platter, and toss the parchment, no mess or pans to clean.<br /><br />I love the broad range of international influences that abound, from Thai-style chicken salad and Korean BBQ Tofu Tacos to Thai-flavored pumpkin custard, Goan shrimp curry, Japanese (baked eggplant with miso-ginger glaze), French cuisine (duck breasts with warm lentil salad, duck confit, vichyssoise), Latin dishes, and more.<br /><br />As a longtime vegetarian (now pescetarian, although I eat a vegetarian / vegan diet 90% of the time), I really appreciated a whole chapter devoted to vegetarian and vegan entrees; all too often, vegetarian mains are an afterthought, but here we have Indian eggs with spicy tomato pepper sauce, zucchini patties with garlicky yogurt sauce, spicy greens ravioli, Korean vegetable pancakes, stir-fried tofu, saag paneer, and Korean BBQ tofu tacos to tempt even the most hardened carnivore.<br /><br />Recipes from guest chefs include many familiar names such as Joanne Chang (Flour, Boston), Hiroko Shimbo, Jacques Torres, Marc Vetri, and stir-fry guru Grace Young. The book is rounded out with online and mail order sources, a handy seasonal produce guide, and metric equivalents.<br /><br />The one negative is that the book is not bound well; my copy has already split at the seams despite careful handling, and the cardboard cover seems to be on the flimsy side given the book’s weight and bends easily.<br /><br />Otherwise, I look forward to trying many more recipes from Home Cooking 101 in the weeks and months to come!\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Delicious and easy way to eat your veggies; you'll never miss the fish!\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Izumi Shoji, Japanese housewife and mother, is the hugely successful vegetarian blogger, author, and owner of the Izumi Shoji Cooking School in Tokyo. Izumi decided to become vegetarian after the birth of her daughter twenty-one years ago through a gradual transition to vegetarianism. Believing that vegetable dishes are colorful, bright, and beautiful (and more forgiving than cooking meat dishes), she started her blog in 2007 as there were no Japanese-language cookbooks on vegetarian cooking available at that time. By writing a successful blog, she hoped to publish a book on vegetarian cooking. Now with over fifty books published in Japanese, “The Vegetable Sushi Cookbook” is her first title to be translated into English.<br /><br />I was so excited when I heard that Kodansha was publishing her vegetarian sushi cookbook in English; as a longtime vegetarian living in Japan, I’ve been unable to enjoy most types of sushi as most contain seafood. (The few exceptions available to vegetarians are natto, gourd, and cucumber rolls, omelet, and inari-zushi, a fried tofu pouch stuffed with plain rice). Vegetable sushi is just now catching on here but is perhaps more a novelty than anything else; popular chain Sushi Nova introduced some similar vegetable (but not vegetarian; one contains prosciutto) sushi on its menu last year, but purely vegetarian rolls are still a rarity in the land of seafood.<br /><br />The more than 100 recipes in “The Vegetable Sushi Cookbook” include many popular types of sushi including nigiri-zushi, maki-zushi, chirashi-zushi, gunkan-zushi, oshi-zushi, temari-zushi, maze-zushi and inari-zushi and show off Japanese veggies and herbs to their best advantage, including my personal favorites renkon (lotus root), eggplant, takenoko (baby bamboo), gobo (burdock), enoki, eringi, and shiitake mushrooms, turnips, leeks, etc. If you’re a fan of mouth-puckering umeboshi (pickled plums), you’re in luck; there are many recipes punched up with umeboshi, including the shiitake steamed with umeboshi plum maze-zushi, umeboshi plum and ginger-flavored turnip nigiri-zushi, asparagus and umeboshi plum maki-zushi.<br />You’ll find full-color photographs and detailed instructions on making great sushi rice (the most important part of making sushi; instructions are given for rice cooker and clay pot methods), simple steps to extract the most flavor from a wide range of Japanese veggies, and additional side dishes that complement the sushi. A beautifully photographed ingredients and tools glossary will make it easy to take the book along to your nearest Asian / Japanese supermarket to purchase (potentially) unfamiliar items.<br /><br />This was my first attempt at making sushi, so with nervous anticipation, I purchased the ingredients for the steamed enoki mushroom gunkanmaki (p. 39), gingered bamboo shoot nigirizushi (p. 37), and mustard-flavored cabbage temarizushi (p. 69). As I live in Japan, I am fortunate to have abundant access to ultra-fresh Japanese veggies and herbs, but don’t worry; even if you can’t find uniquely Japanese ingredients like lotus root, there are plenty of recipes calling for staples like cabbage, mushrooms (both fresh and dried), carrots, asparagus, tomatoes, etc. Some of the recipes call for Western ingredients like balsamic vinegar (I used the amazing Fustini’s 18-year balsamic from my home state of Michigan).<br /><br />Each recipe yields a small number of rolls (usually around three to four); because the recipes are so simple, it’s no trouble to double or triple a recipe if you anticipate a crowd. Ingredients are listed in both US and metric. Instructions are clear and concise, and some include step-by-step photos (maki-zushi, for example). I had no problems in following along and producing appealing sushi (see photos!). My favorite of the three I’ve tried so far was definitely the cabbage-flavored mustard; I loved the flavor so much I made a cabbage mustard salad out of the remaining head of cabbage!<br />If you don’t have access to pre-cut nori (here in Japan, you can purchase already trimmed nori designed for onigiri, musubi, gunkan-maki, etc.), be sure to use a very sharp knife or the nori will tear instead of cutting neatly. I found that scoring with a chef’s knife then bending at the score was also a good technique.<br /><br />Many of the recipes call for no special equipment, but it’s worth investing in a few staples used to make sushi, such as a bamboo makisu (sushi rolling mat; Lekue also makes a great [[ASIN:B000PKRSO6 Lekue Silicone Makisu Mat, Clear]] that I use in combination with a bamboo makisu as cleaning is much easier), plastic rice paddle ([[ASIN:B00DV52ZXG Kotobuki Swing Shamoji Serving Rice Paddle]] if you already have an electric Japanese-style rice cooker, it should have come with one; if not, they are inexpensive), and an [[ASIN:B000CPR2H2 1 X Japanese Plastic Oshizushi Press Sushi Box Mold]] if you plan on making pressed sushi (I opted for this plastic one for ease of cleaning, but you can also find beautiful wooden presses made in Japan).<br /><br />I love that such unique and healthy rolls can be produced with literally any vegetables in your crisper (you’ll find ideas for radishes, celery, avocado, carrots, cabbage, etc.) with minimal ingredients and prep, preserving the natural colors, flavors and nutrients of the veggies and showing them off to their best advantage. It’s a fun way to incorporate more veggies into your diet, and if you have children in your house, many of these recipes can be adapted for younger helpers once the veggies are simmered / steamed, etc. My copy of “The Vegetable Sushi Cookbook” is flagged with dozens of other sushi recipes I can’t wait to try; highly recommended!<br /><br />(This review was originally published on Bundt Lust on 15 April 2016)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Meditation and bread baking are the perfect complement...',\n",
       "  'text': 'I previously reviewed Dahlia Abraham-Klein’s [[ASIN:0804843376 Silk Road Vegetarian: Vegan, Vegetarian and Gluten Free Recipes for the Mindful Cook [Vegetarian Cookbook, 101 Recipes]]] for Amazon, and loved the blend of Middle Eastern and Central Asian flavors; low-fat and full of flavor, there are also many gluten-free and dairy-free recipes (including baked goods). In her latest book Spiritual Kneading, Dahlia combines meditation and reflection with the traditionally feminine task of making, blessing, and baking the challah, a bread with deep spiritual and cultural meaning central to Jewish life.<br /><br />Spiritual Kneading uses the medium of meditation while kneading and working the dough to reflect on various passages and themes for each Jewish month. Beginning with an introduction to the feminine dimension of Rosh Chodesh and challah, there is a fascinating look at the origins of separating challah in midrashic verse. There are instructions how to form a Rosh Chodesh Challah Baking Group (“Spiritual Kneaders”), with a curriculum for each month of study and a helpful planner including an outline, equipment, and calendar. Further reading suggestions are also included to extend the use of the book beyond the first year. Numerous prayers in Hebrew (some transliterated) and English are included. Each month’s syllabus contains a specific challah recipe and shape that mirrors that month’s theme. Each recipe includes an introduction to the challah theme during the yeast activation, meditation during kneading, and a discussion during the rising, as well as reflective questions.<br /><br />Although I’ve been baking challah for years, I learned so many fascinating historical facts, customs and the use of challah across the centuries through Spiritual Kneading; baking challah is truly forging a connection across time. The significance of each ingredient took on new meaning as I continued to read and bake. I also love that Dahlia recommends using organic, fair-trade ingredients when baking; this is something I try to practice every day.<br /><br />Beginning with Tishrei, the first month of the year, there is a traditional spiral challah with apple and silan (date syrup, the original “honey” mentioned in the Torah/Bible). Rosh Hashanah traditionally has us dip apples in honey for a sweet year, and spiral challahs are traditional as well, representing positive changes in the new year (others believe it represents a crown. Other loaves include a (dairy) braided cheese loaf for Kislev (there is also a pareve option), Seven Species pomegranate-shaped challah for Shvat, boiled egg in challah (chubzeh di Purim) for Adar Alef, a gorgeous rose-shaped challah with raisins and rosewater for Adar Bet, and a crown-shaped challah with olive oil and za’atar for Elul. The basic dough recipe for each is the same, and is scaled to make 8-10 medium loaves (as I am baking for a small household, I scaled each recipe to 1/4, which yields two medium loaves).<br /><br />I’ve been baking challah for years, but was intrigued by the book’s premise of merging meditation (which I practice frequently) with bread baking; I had always found the rhythm of kneading to be soothing, and it lends itself well as a time for reflection. I made the rose-shaped challah with raisins and rosewater using the crown-shaped braiding instructions, and I can say without a doubt that this is truly the most beautiful loaf of challah I’ve ever made. I used premium yeast from my friends at Red Star Yeast, who were kind enough to send samples, as well as imported Lebanese rosewater from Maureen Abood’s online market.<br /><br />The basic dough recipe is a water challah (no eggs or butter) with a little olive oil added:<br />Basic dough recipe:<br />4 tablespoons active dry yeast<br />4 ½ cups (1.1L) warm water<br />¾ cup (150g) organic sugar plus 2 tablespoons organic sugar<br />5 pounds (2.25 kg) organic white flour<br />1 ½ tablespoons sea salt<br />1 cup (230 ml) neutral-tasting oil (some recipes call for olive oil)<br /><br />This dough is more common with Sephardic Jews rather than the perhaps more familiar “eggy” challah baked by Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe; Sephardic Jews believe that adding eggs to the dough renders the challah more like cake, and thus ineligible for the Hamotzi blessing.<br /><br />The basic dough recipe very easy to work with and produces a light, fluffy, sweet challah (the base recipe calls for added sugar) that invites add-ins. As I primarily cook in metric, I appreciated that metric weights were included for portions of each recipe. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow (and the step-by-step photos were a lifesafer, especially for my first attempt at braiding a four-strand crown loaf!).  The cooking times were also very accurate; the recipe mentioned 30-35 minutes, and mine took 30 exactly (my old oven tended to run hot, so breads baked faster / more unevenly).<br /><br />I love that the author also includes a challah recipe using fresh yeast; one of my earliest memories in the kitchen is of my Polish grandmother baking bread with fresh yeast, and it’s a tradition I’ve tried to uphold (I generally purchase fresh yeast from bakeries as the Fleishman brand once found in the grocery store seems to be a relic of the past due to its rapid spoilage). Recipes for spelt, whole wheat, and a gluten-free oat challah (which requires shaping in a silicone mold as it is not braidable) are also included. Other shapes and braids (single strand, two-strand, four-strand, six-strand) are also included, with super-helpful step-by-step photos for the braiding.<br /><br />Not only are the bread recipes delicious, creative, and reliable, but I really connected with Dahlia’s choice of reflections for each bread. Many stories from the Torah are brought to life with details I’d never noticed before, and the choice of readings and reflective questions really bring a deeper spirituality to making challah. I look forward to baking my way through the rest of the book over the coming year!<br />Anyone interested in bread baking  should add this title to your collection; the step-by-step photos and helpful text demystify yeast baking for all audiences.<br /><br />(This review originally published on Bundt Lust April 13, 2016)',\n",

       "  'text': \"As a huge fan of Sarina's Sepharic Cuisine blog and app, I was thrilled to hear that she was publishing her first standalone cookbook, &#34;Backyard Kitchen: Mediterranean Salads.&#34; Published in the New York Times, NT Times Jewish Cookbook, and Joan Nathan's [[ASIN:0375402764 Jewish Cooking in America: Expanded Edition (Knopf Cooks American)]], Mr. Roffe's book includes many recipes handed down from mother to daughter with love and are traditional foods found in the Levant. Her grandmother, Ester Cohen Salem, immigrated to America through Beiruit and was the first to own a Syrian Jewish catering service Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Her backyard kitchen became the center of life for the entire Syrian community in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Salads are common throughout the Middle East, although certain salads are only found among Sephardic families, such as Syrian-style potato salad and avocado salad. Many of these salads feature olive oil and lemon juice in dressings, but do not use lettuce as the Middle East is an arid region and water is at a premium.<br /><br />As I am vegetarian, I LOVED the range of healthful salads here, including Sephardi-style beets with tamarind paste, fava bean salad with hard-boiled eggs, babaghanouj, fruited couscous (apple Craisin, cranapple carrot, seven species) and homemade pickles, another staple at Mediterranean and Middle Eastern tables (cauliflower, turnips, mushrooms). Other than tamarind paste and pomegranate molasses (both of which I always keep in my fridge!), the recipes use everyday ingredients. All recipes are labeled as parve or dairy. Other than one or two recipes that call for salmon and tuna, all are suitable for vegetarians. Certain recipes also feature video demonstrations on Sarina's website. Handy notes also point out the origins and health benefits of each dish, along with suggested pairings.<br /><br />This is a lovely addition to your cookbook library that is perfect for summer; these salads are light and refreshing (unlike many American-style picnic salads and coleslaws), chock full of colorful veggies and fruits, and the perfect way to use up summer's bounty.\",\n",

The range of breads that they bake and deliver includes Iran (nan-e-barbari, a chewy flatbread topped with black and white sesame seeds, and nan-e-qandi), Morocco (m'smen, a flaky flatbread traditionally served for breakfast with honey), Mexico (corn tortillas), Eastern Europe (challah), Ethiopia (the slightly sour injera, fermented teff flour served with wat), and more.\\u200b<br /><br /> The long-awaited Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook is divided by bread type: unleavened and flatbreads, lean breads and rolls, enriched breads, rolls, and buns, filled doughs, and quick breads and holiday breads. You'll find favorites from India (paratha, naan, chapatis), the Middle East (hummus, pita), Eastern Europe (challah, matzo, eier kichel, bialys, knishes, kreplach, nut roll), France / Italy (batard, pan bagnat, olive boules, ciabatta) and Mexico / Latin America (pan de muertos, conchas, tortillas, guacamole, tamales, tostadas, empanadas). Other little-known gems include Albanian cheese triangles, Tibetan momos, Another thing I liked was that various recipes are included that use leftover bread, from bread puddings and stale bread (panzanella, tres leches bread pudding with Mexican chocolate sauce, ribollita), to complementary dishes (curry, wat, stews, dips, salads) that pair perfectly with the included bread recipes.<br /><br />I consider myself a fairly competent home baker; I have long worked with yeast breads (including fresh cake yeast) both kneading by hand and stand mixer, and I welcomed the challenge of new bread types. Step-by-step photos (for trickier items like braiding challah) are particularly helpful for novice bakers. As a longtime baker of challah, I particularly appreciated the many challah recipes, including basic, raisin, whole wheat and Sephardic. You'll even find Vietnamese-style bagueettes and iced Vietnamese coffee.<br /><br /> This lovely selection of breads and accompanying dishes, sauces, and sides is rounded out by baker profiles and a very thorough guide to tips, equipment, and bread storage suggestions. Ingredients are given in US volume and metric (for my baking books, I generally prefer weight measurements, so appreciated having the metric weights given). Gorgeous photos give serving suggestions for each bread and side dish featured in the book. A list of online/mail-order sources and a hefty list of acknowledgments round out the book.<br /><br />An excellent resource for home bakers, especially if you already have some prior bread baking experience. This is a fantastic treasure trove if you enjoy trying international bread recipes and new dishes; it would be fun to host themed dinners using the included recipes. Highly recommended!<br /><br />(I received this book through Blogging For Books)\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Simple recipes for a long life, the Shoku-Iku way!',\n",
       "  'text': \"Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori, Shoku Iku (“food education”) is a Japanese concept involving conscious eating: what we eat, how we prepare it, and how different foods are combined. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori, shoku iku is based on the power of five: each meal should have five colors (green/blue, red/orange, white, black/brown, yellow), tastes (sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami), senses, food groups and cooking methods (steam, simmer, broil, grill and fry, no-cook, sushi).<br /><br />Makiko Sano’s new book “Healthy Japanese Cooking” (published in the UK as “Shoku Iku”) immediately caught my eye; having lived in Japan on multiple occasions, I have long been attracted to Japanese washoku (traditional cuisine) and shojin ryori (Buddhist vegan cuisine). Traditional Japanese meals are based on the freshest seasonal ingredients, engage all the senses, and if eaten properly and with mindfulness, should leave you satisfied but not stuffed (the Japanese concept of hara hachi bu, or eat until you are 80 percent full).<br /><br />Beginning with the essential dashi (stock) and dressings (rosemary soy, sweet soy, sesame salad sprinkle, shabu shabu and others), there are very handy illustrations and step-by-step photos to instruct you on rolling sushi, julienning vegetables, etc. Dashi is the backbone of most Japanese soups / hot pots, and you'll find several variations here, including basic dashi (kelp + bonito flakes), vegetarian dashi (kelp and dried shiitake), Motoko's dashi (made with liquid from cooking brown rice; I had not seen this method in my other cookbooks!), and two soup stocks.<br /><br />I found the chapter on steaming particularly helpful as I have not cooked fish via this method before, but you’ll find heavenly steamed sea bream, a posh cod dinner in 20 minutes, steamed chicken, stuffed veggies, pork dumplings, etc., most cooked in the microwave. However, a word of caution; these recipes were tested at 800 watts, and it would appear that American microwaves are more powerful in general (mine is 1.58 kW), so you may need to adjust cooking times.<br /><br />Some of the steamed dishes are cooked on the stovetop; my new favorite discovery is the “Full Japanese” garden breakfast, full of leafy greens, tomatoes, mushrooms and eggs nestled into the greens. I also loved the vegan monk recipe for stuffed pumpkin and steamed sticky rice, which is full of carrots, shiitake, and mushrooms (you can leave out the chicken to make it vegan). And my favorite steamed custard chawanmushi also makes an appearance, as do perfect teatime snacks mochi, sweet potato treats, and fruit buns.<br /><br />The fried chapter includes Japanese burgers and shrimp barbecue, but you’ll also find healthy low-fat vegetarian options like Japanese grilled vegetable “stir fry” (half grilled, half steamed), eggplant and shallot salad, “full of goodness” (with a liberal helping of my favorite Japanese vegetable, lotus root!), and chili tofu. The sushi chapter features an amazing brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi, temaki, sesame seed salmon sushi, brown rice tuna sushi with sweet-hot sauce, five senses super-tasty salmon sushi, and some new variations like wasabi cream cheese sushi with lamb, avocado and pear quinoa power sushi, and sushi canapes.<br /><br />Ingredients are listed both in metric and US (volume). Beautiful full-color photos by Lisa Linder capture the aesthetic of Japanese cuisine, with beautiful tableware that offsets the featured dish perfectly.<br /><br />The resulting dishes, all of which embrace the “shoku iku” philosophy, are light, nutritious, and provide plenty of variety of colors, flavors, and textures that are sure to brighten any meal. I found several new dishes that I plan on making frequently, including the egg and tofu dashi soup, rice noodles with mushroom broth, pan tai, iced tomatoes, brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi, and steamed sticky rice.<br /><br />If you are new to Japanese cooking / flavors, then “Healthy Japanese Cooking” is the perfect introduction as it uses commonplace ingredients (you may have to order some of the more traditional ingredients like kombu and bonito flakes online), simple techniques, and is aligned much more closely with the traditional Japanese diet based on fish and vegetables than many Japanese cookbooks aimed at Western audiences.<br /><br />(Thank you to Makiko Sano for the review copy!)\",\n",

       "  'title': '“Lucky Peach” a good (if basic) guide to Asian (and Asian-inspired) cuisine',\n",
       "  'text': 'I’m fairly new to the “Lucky Peach” magazine (I recently used the LP article “The Meaning of Mangoes” with my advanced ESL students) and just spent six months working (and cooking / eating my way across) Taiwan, so I was thrilled to see that Lucky Peach had a cookbook coming out. “Lucky Peach Presents 101 Easy Asian Recipes” is true to its title; beginning with a genius illustrated guide to the Asian pantry (presented in basic, intermediate, and champion levels), this book will help you take baby steps to becoming proficient with Asian tools, ingredients and cooking methods. Do note that if you are even passingly familiar with basic cooking techniques and Asian cooking in general, this book is likely a little simpler than you are looking for, but it would be great for college students and those new to the kitchen.<br /><br />The book is based on two main rules: no frying, and no subrecipes.<br /><br />Beginning with cold dishes, appetizers and “pickly bits,” you’ll find classics like garlic-smashed cucumbers, seaweed salad, soy sauce eggs, green papaya salad, and dumplings. I was a little surprised not to see the ubiquitous Taiwanese tea eggs make an appearance. I was also hoping for a chapter of standalone egg dishes like chawanmushi (steamed egg custard also found in Taiwan) as I am a firm believer in breakfast for dinner, but there are several substantial egg dishes throughout the book (omurice, dashiaki tamago, egg foo young).<br /><br />Pancakes include Japanese okonomiyaki, Taiwan / China contributes scallion pancakes (my favorite Taiwanese snack hands-down!), and there are several Korean pancakes in addition to moo shu pancakes and vegetables. Soups and stews offer some rather surprising combinations like miso clam chowder and rotisserie chicken ramen; you’ll also find a slow-cooker pho, vegetarian hot pot and Massaman curry.<br /><br />Noodles include soba, jap chae, pad see ew, pesto ramen, and spicy mushroom ragu. Having lived in Japan and Taiwan and having sampled numerous excellent noodle dishes in both, I was honestly expecting more from the noodle chapter. Where is udon? Cold sesame noodles? Many types of noodles are covered in the discussion in ingredients, but not used in later chapters.<br /><br />I was more enthused about the rice dishes; ume and kabocha rice, onigiri, omurice and sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves are all dishes I can see myself making frequently. I was surprised that there weren’t more Taiwanese / Thai-style fried rice recipes, although there is a basic &#34;build your own&#34; guide to adding sauce and extras. Vegetarians will delight in the simple yet tasty veggie options, including miso-glazed eggplant (one of my favorite ways to prepare it), stir-fried asparagus, bok choy with oyster sauce (you can find vegetarian oyster sauce in larger Asian supermarkets), dry-fried green beans, roasted squash with red glaze, and roasted sweet potatoes.<br /><br />The book really shines in its treatment of poultry and meat dishes; I felt it was much more successful than the noodle dishes. You’ll find twelve chicken recipes ranging from Japanese (oyakodon), Filipino (chicken adobo), Korean, and Chinese (five-spice, lacquered, Hainan Chicken rice, Chinese chicken salad).<br /><br />The dressings and sauces chapter was very handy; I love the carrot-ginger dressing, two ginger scallion sauces, tofu dressing, and the odd flavor sauce. Curiously, the desserts chapter only offered two recipes: oranges, and egg custard tarts. Yes, I get that in traditional Chinese culture, “dessert” may consist of fruit (in Taiwan, if you are visiting someone’s home, fruit is always brought as a gift). However, seeing the heavy Thai / Vietnamese / Japanese influence in other chapters, I’m surprised that more Asian sweets weren’t included (mangoes with sticky rice, green tea infused desserts, etc.). Several chapters suffered from similar brevity; the breakfast chapter only includes four recipes (again, I was surprised not to see congee here as it can be made in a rice cooker). It also took some getting used to that the notes came after the recipes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good first cookbook if you are new to Asian cuisine; the illustrated pantry guide is immensely helpful if you are new to these ingredients and trying to locate them in an Asian supermarket. It’s also very handy for quick pickles, basic dumplings (using premade wrappers), etc. Illustrations for slightly trickier dishes like dashimaki tamago and dumplings are very helpful. However, I felt like it could have had so much more potential given the huge range of variety and influences in Asian cuisine.<br /><br />(I received this book through Blogging for Books)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Bold, in your face, and full of love - Modern Israeli Cooking',\n",
       "  'text': \"I am a huge fan of Israeli cuisine and have read numerous cookbooks in the last several years focusing on this diverse cuisine, so I was excited to be offered &#34;Modern Israeli Cooking&#34; by Danielle Oron, the creative force behind Moo Milk Bar and the blog &#34;I Will Not East Oysters.&#34; Danielle's family moved from Tel Aviv to New Jersey when she was a toddler, and her family was known as &#34;those crazy Israelis.&#34; In her words, these recipes combine her culinary background in French technique with classic Israeli flavors to create new and modern dishes.<br /><br />Modern Israel is a melting pot; you'll find cuisine from Morocco, Eastern Europe, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey. Dishes are served family-style with a lot of side plates consisting of salads and dips; this is my personal culinary heaven. The recipes are divided into weekdays (chicken shawarma rice bowl, kofta kebab freekeh salad, za'atar chicken, pashtida), Fridays (challah, ricotta and za'atar ravioli, lemon chicken with olives, harissa lamb meatballs), beach (peel and eat harissa shrimp - if you haven't guessed already, this is NOT a kosher cookbook), salmon ceviche, chermoula fish tacos, seared sesame tuna), slow cooking (braised pomegranate short ribs, roasted garli and apricot chicken, hawaij oxtail ragu, pastrami), brunch (shakshuka, bourekas, babka French toast, za'atar sesame mini bagels), midnight (za'atar fried eggs, feta grilld cheese, cinnamon challah), salads and sides (tabbouleh, carrots several ways, pickled beets), sweets (saled tahini chocolate chip cookies, tahini-swirled brownies, halva morning buns, honey and apple cake), and stapes (tahini, ancho chili harissa, labne, schug, preserved lemons, dukkah). Ingredients are given in US (volume) and metric.<br /><br />Danielle's commentary is on the hip side; recipe subtitles frequently involve food puns and cultural insights, like the mild red pepper harissa: &#34;If you like the flavor, but you have a death wish / enjoy S&M, add more of the Thai chilis and a bit more hot paprika.&#34;) or tahini: &#34;We put this sh*t on everything.&#34;<br /><br />True to the book's goal, you will find classic flavors with modern twists; the beloved sabich has been turned into a breakfast bowl with shredded potato hash, falafel gets some help from spinach and is served with green tahini and sauerkraut, you'll find Sephardic pastries like bourekas supersized and dressed up with mushrooms and caramelized onions, Milky has been reinvented as a decadent, boozy pot de creme. I loved the peppered watermelon and feta, as watermelon + mint + Bulgarian feta is a staple breakfast in my house; here, Korean red pepper flakes and black pepper kick this up a notch.<br /><br />Overall this is a fun, young take on modern Israeli cooking - you'll find many familiar flavor profiles (za'atar, tahini, sumac, schug, dukkah) and plenty of colorful veggie salads and sides to dress up your table. From a comfort food perspective, it contains the most amazing grilled cheese recipe (feta grilled with Kalamata olives - heaven!), eggs and sumac soldiers, and many warming dishes that would be great for cooler nights (braised pomegranate short ribs, sweet shredded honey lamb, beer-braised holiday brisket, homemade pastrami).<br />*For those who keep kosher, please note that this is NOT a kosher cookbook - it contains shellfish recipes as well as meat mixed with dairy. However, most of the recipes are (or can be made) kosher with a little tweaking.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Redefining kosher: Fresh, seasonal, beautiful flavorful and delicious!',\n",
       "  'text': \"I have cooked from (and reviewed) numerous kosher cookbooks over the years, but I have to say that Kim Kushner’s “The New Kosher” is quickly becoming one of my favorite titles in my collection. True to its title “Simple Recipes to Savor and Share,” you’ll find contemporary gems such as giant ricotta ravioli with cinnamon, miso-tahini glazed cod, braised beef ribs with cider-rosemary sauce, and some fabulous ideas for brunch (the spinach and feta quiche with heirloom tomatoes, asparagus and goat cheese quiche, and caramelized red onion and dill frittata with smoked salmon are going to be in frequent rotation on the weekends in my house!).<br /><br />Kim’s essentials include great noshes like five-minute sun dried tomato hummus with homemade pita chips with za’atar, butternut squash chips with herbes de provence, and a variety of quick and easy toppings that come in handy for other recipes (spicy maple crumb topping, za’atar everything topping, and lazy crumb topping which is particularly good on baked fish such as the Lazy But Crispy Fish.<br /><br />In addition to a strong Middle Eastern influence (Kim’s mother was born in Morocco and grew up in Israel) in dishes like charred eggplant dip with maple drizzle, poisson a la marocaine (whitefish marinated then cooked in saffron water with preserved lemons and paprika oil), crispy rice cake with saffron crust, hummus, etc., there is a marked Asian influence, which I particularly enjoyed. Nods to the East include ginger-scallion dip with sesame seeds (this would be amazing as a dip for scallion pancakes!), kohlrabi, edamame and carrots in ginger-miso marinade, arctic char with wasabi-mirin sauce over rice noodles, miso tahini glazed cod, tamari salmon with edamame, and Thai-style summer salmon. There are also kid-friendly recipes like individual mac and cheese, kids’ steaks (marinated and cooked in a low oven rather than grilled), and deconstructed s’mores.<br /><br />Vegetarians and pescetarians like myself will find many colorful, appealing dishes, particularly the salads and veggies (and fish for those of us that eat fish). I recently tried my first (fresh-off-the-tree) pomelos in Taiwan, and loved seeing the pomelo salad with red onion, mint and cilantro as well as the light, umami-packed Asian salads like kohlrabi, edamame and carrots in ginger-miso marinade, savoy slaw with lemongrass and lime dressing, and avocado, heats of palm, edamame and za’atar salad. Fans of Ottolenghi’s [[ASIN:1452101248 Plenty: Vibrant Vegetable Recipes from London's Ottolenghi]] and [[ASIN:1607746212 Plenty More: Vibrant Vegetable Cooking from London's Ottolenghi]] will feel right at home here.<br /><br />And although the dishes are easily doable by a home cook, you’ll also find elegant presentations such as braised beef short ribs with cider-herb reduction, veal roast with porcini, thyme, and garlic rub, lamb rib chops with red wine vinegar, mint and garlic, and seared tuna steaks with sun-dried tomato and jalapeno preserves that are perfect for more formal gatherings or special occasions.<br /><br />The desserts chapter offered some great alternatives to my usual lineup, my new favorite being the dark bark with rose petals, pistachios and walnuts. I started making my own chocolate bark recently using my rice cooker (!) to melt / temper the chocolate (frequently I’ll make pomegranate bark using fresh pomegranate seeds), and I loved the addition of rose petals to add a real Persian flair. You’ll find time-tested Jewish classics like coffee cake, macaroons, and hamantaschen with three fillings (hello Ferrero Rocher!) alongside biscotti, a healthier take on crostata, and an almond granita.<br /><br />The book’s graphic layout is clean and eye-catching, with full-page photos and beautifully tiled chapter headers. Ingredients are given in US and metric measurements, which I really appreciated.<br /><br />Even if you don’t keep kosher, these are great recipes for beautiful, vibrant foods that your family and friends are sure to enjoy. One note for kosher home cooks: recipes are not labeled as dairy, meat or pareve as with most other kosher cookbooks in my collection; generally chapters are separated by meat, seafood, etc., but in some chapters like soups and dips, you may need to scan the ingredients to determine if it is dairy, meat, or pareve.<br /><br />(Thank you to the author for the review copy and mazel on a gorgeous cookbook!)\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Gorgeous book for serious home chefs',\n",
       "  'text': \"I have hundreds of cookboks, many of them regional and international, but so far none that had focused on the cuisine of New England (the closest thing in my collection is &#34;Made in Quebec&#34;), so I was excited to review this. I consider myself to be a fairly accomplished home chef and baker (I've taken more than 70 cooking classes in the US, France, Taiwan and Japan), and the recipes in &#34;The New New England Cookbook&#34; are definitely challenging, with numerous components that need to be assembled and plated. These are elegant seasonal recipes that would be perfectly at home at your next dinner party or holiday event, but for me, too time-consuming to be made on a regular basis. There is a heavy French and Mediterranean influence throughout, with dishes such as seared duck breast, osso buco, bisques and gougeres. Each season has two complete menus; I particularly loved the salad courses, which included arugula salad with almonds, green olives and blood oranges, endive salad with grapefruit, roasted pistachios and roasted beets, and a frisee salad with confit apples, cheddar and candied pecans. The desserts also shine, including several panna cottas, bread puddings, and grilled fruit. However, for those looking for more &#34;classic&#34; recipes (or homestyle recipes that can be prepared with relatively short prep time), &#34;The New New England Cookbook&#34; is, in the author's own words, &#34;New England fare with a twist - these aren't your grandma's recipes.&#34; If you aren't intimidated by intricate prep (homemade savory marshmallows, emulsions) and more expensive cuts of meat/seafood (scallops, quail, rack of lamb, veal, duck breast, monkfish), the end result is rewarding, elegant recipes. Beautiful photographs showcase the seasonal ingredients and final plated dishes. This is a beautiful cookbook, but due to the expensive nature of many of the ingredients (which may be difficult to come by depending on where you live, fresh seafood being a prime example) and the lengthy prep sometimes required, this will be reserved for special occasions rather than everyday cooking.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This is the perfect jumping-off point if you’re new to cooking and baking with yogurt and are looking for more ways to incorporate it into your diet; I frequently eat yogurt at least twice a day and use it in a variety of dishes as a marinade, in baking, etc., and really appreciated the quick, easy ideas in “Yogurt,” particularly the Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian accents.<br /><br />Far beyond simple parfaits or yogurt-based dips such as tzatziki, yogurt can be used as the base for a number of versatile appetizers, soups, salads, main dishes (particularly as a marinade for meats), and desserts. In “Yogurt,” Janet Fletcher (longtime contributor to the San Francisco Chronicle and author of the Planet Cheese newsletter) collects a wide range of tantalizing recipes using yogurt, from breakfast parfaits to more unusual applications such as Seared Mushrooms & Shallots in Yogurt with Garam Masala, Harissa-Roasted Chicken with Sweet Peppers, Cucumber Salad with Yogurt, Golden Raisins, Walnuts & Mint, and Indian Yogurt Pudding with Saffron, Cardamom & Toasted Nuts (Shrikhand).<br /><br />You’ll find advice on making your own yogurt as well as selecting store-bought (as well as when it is acceptable to substitute lower-fat yogurt in a recipe), a great guide to seasonal fruit for breakfast parfaits, yogurt with eggs, and other add-ins. Many of these are suggestions more than recipes per se. Note that the book only refers to dairy-based yogurts; you won’t find suggestions or mentions of soy- or alternative non-dairy yogurts (hemp, coconut, rice, etc.).<br /><br />I loved the appetizers section in particular, as Greek and Turkish mezze are some of my favorite foods on earth (and also vegetarian-friendly!). Recipes like Yogurt Cheese with Feta, Pumpkin Seeds and Za’atar, Grated Beet and Yogurt Salad with Beet Greens, and Chopped Summer Vegetable Salad with Farro, Yogurt and Za’atar make perfect summer meals when it’s too hot to cook. Meat dishes feature many Mediterranean-inspired lamb and yogurt dishes (including a recipe for homemade skillet flatbread for souvlaki), while veggie dishes offer a blend of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors. I also loved the Fettuccine with Fried Onions, Yogurt and Poppy Seeds, and the light, fruit-based desserts like panna cotta, Warm Baked Figs with Pernod, Candied Walnuts and Yogurt, and Yogurt Mousse with Orange Marmalade and Toasted Almonds. Along the way, gorgeous photographs will inspire you to make many (if not all!) of the dishes in this book. You’ll also find a selection of yogurt-based drinks such as Indian lassi, smoothies, and ayran. Finally, a fairly thorough bibliography and list of mail order / online resources for supplies will give you plenty of tools to embark on your own yogurt journey.<br /><br />*I received this book through Blogging for Books',\n",

       "  'text': 'I’ll admit to not being familiar with Tara O’Brady’s blog “Seven Spoons” before being offered the chance to review the cookbook, but I will most certainly be following her in the future. Beginning with a very nice overview (with specific brands) for common seasonings (including my favorite secret weapon gojuchang!), flavoring agents, and measurements, “Seven Spoons” contains a versatile arsenal of recipes that really appealed to me. As I love breakfast any time of day, the breakfast chapter in particular was particularly tempting, with such gems as fig and ginger granola, bostocks, a savory steel-cut oatmeal, chocolate olive oil zucchini bread, and vanilla espresso walnut butter starting (or ending!) to start your day right.<br /><br />Main dishes include a variety of chicken, seafood (including an unctuous slow-baked salmon with butter beans), and beef. Many of the recipes are vegetarian-friendly as well, including fattoush with fava and labneh, hummus with white miso, mushrooms and greens with toast, olive and orange cauliflower, the North Indian baked eggs that are reminiscent of Israeli breakfast staple shakshouka, and a notable section of desserts and pantry staples. I have dozens of baking and dessert cookbooks, and really loved some of Tara’s simple yet elegant recipes like fig toasts with buttered honey, blood orange stout cake, Vietnamese coffee ice cream, and roasted grapes with sweet labneh. The staples section includes guidance on making numerous dairy products at home (cultured and flavored butters, crème fraiche, ricotta, yogurt, and dressings). The compound butter section was excellent, including some suggestions I had not seen in my many other cookbooks (as the author is Canadian, I appreciated the addition of maple butter). The maple, tapenade, and sweet fennel pollen butters will be starring in regular rotation in my kitchen,<br /><br />Recipes are generally quite simple (which makes them perfect for novice cooks), with ingredients given in Imperial volume and metric measurements. There’s a distinctive Indian and Middle Eastern flair running throughout, from veggie pakoras and homemade naan to za’atar chicken, halloumi with chermoula, roasted carrots with harissa aioli and dukkah, and a lentil kofta curry.<br /><br />Along the way, recipes are rounded out with gorgeous photography (for those who prefer their cookbooks to be photo-heavy, note that not every recipe has a photo). I loved the tone of each recipe foreword, and the excellent section on pantry staples. This is a book that is both appealing and practical, with most ingredients readily available at my supermarket and many recipes that can be put together fairly quickly, meaning that it will see regular rotation in my kitchen!

       "  'text': 'Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls, cookies, breads and cheesecake and reinvents them, using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction, the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor, muffled complexity, and concealed true richness,” so her goal was to create delicious, healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.<br /><br />Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings), including peppercorn and chile, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and cardamom, ginger, and savory herbs and spices. Along the way, Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style, along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.<br /><br />Cinnamon, hazelnut and date buns, ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam, orange and honey baklava, orange-clove pull-apart bread, and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago, I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee), so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!<br /><br />Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on; there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results, particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.<br /><br />In addition to familiar treats, you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles, clafoutis and tarte tatin, Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread, Thai banana fritters, Indonesian kue lapis, Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall, and other fragrant, delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker, I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!<br /><br />(I received my copy through Blogging for Books)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Donabe – Make the most from this versatile kitchen powerhouse!',\n",
       "  'text': 'Having lived in Japan, I’ve amassed quite a collection of Japanese cookbooks and housewares, the one exception being a donabe, a clay pot used to stew, simmer, steam, and smoke. Perhaps best known as the vessel in which oden is cooked, the donabe is an extremely versatile tool and durable as well. From the words “do” (土), “earth”, and nabe (鍋), “pot,” donabe are used to cook dishes known as nabemono, including shabu-shabu.<br /><br />There are relatively few works in English that focus on the donabe, so I was thrilled to review Naoko Takei Moore and Kyle Connaughton’s “Donabe” when it came out. Naoko grew up in Tokyo, and like many Japanese, associated donabes with hot pot until she had rice made in a double-lid donabe; it turned out to be one of the most striking food discoveries that she ever experienced. She began to network with an Iga-based artisanal pottery company to import their donabe to the United States.<br /><br />Six styles of donabe pots are covered here: classic, rice cooker, soup and stew, steamer, tagi ne style, and smoker. Note that donabe are best used with gas or on a portable butane stove (a common fixture in most Japanese homes and hotpot restaurants); they should not be used on induction or ceramic cooktops. Like other clay vessels, do not submit your donabe to drastic changes in temperature or heat when empty as the clay may crack. With proper care and seasoning, a donabe can last for several decades of faithful use.<br /><br />After a very thorough 50-page introduction into the history, production, seasoning and care of donabe, the six types of recipes begin. Rice measurements are based on the traditional Japanese unit “go.” Nonrice measurements use US measurements with metric equivalents. An extensive glossary provides additional guidance on ingredients and resources. Recipes are also labeled as vegan or vegetarian as appropriate. As a longtime vegetarian / pescetarian, I appreciated this touch as Japanese cuisine is not very vegetarian-friendly with the exception of vegan temple cuisine (shojin ryori); even most vegetable dishes like daikon “steaks” feature katsuobushi, shavings of dried smoked bonito.<br /><br />Classic-style donabe includes various hot pots, while double-lid donabe rice cooker recipes include salted kombu and ginger rice, salmon and hijiki rice, English peas and yuba rice (I love cooking with yuba, dried tofu “skin” made from soymilk), green tea rice balls, azuki sticky rice, and crab dashi. Some of my favorites are featured in the steamer chapter (savory steamed soy custard with saikyo miso sauce, steamed black cod in fermented black bean sauce, green tea steam cake) and the tagine chapter (sizzling tofu and mushrooms in miso sauce, steam-roasted fingerling potatoes, steam-fried vegetables with creamy sesame-tofu dipping sauce, crunchy lotus root in black vinegar sauce). Using the donabe as a smoker was new for me, and I loved the very Western smoked Camembert, nuts, and dried figs with rosemary and more traditional smoked miso-marinated tofu. Basic dashi and condiments such as kombu and shiitake dashi, yuzu ponzu, saikyo miso aioli, and sesame dipping sauce are also provided. The gorgeous photography by Eric Wolfinger showcases traditional donabe craftsmen at work, along with beautifully shot still lifes of donabes at work. Each recipe has a gorgeous full-color photo that accompanies it.<br /><br />Overall, “Donabe” is a gorgeous cookbook that has filled a void in my extensive Japanese cookbook collection. It is an excellent guide to making the most of this versatile tool (if you do not currently have a donabe, I imagine that an Emile Henry or Revol clay French oven could be used to make these recipes equally successfully for the most part) and includes many fantastic rice-based dishes that will be sure to make it into regular rotation as we enter winter!<br /><br />(I received this book through NetGalley and Blogging for Books)',\n",

       "  'text': \"Earlier this summer, I ordered the excellent &#34;[[ASIN:0091949475 Curry Easy Vegetarian]] from the UK as I adore Madhur Jaffrey (and vegetarian Indian cookbooks in general, especially the two fantastic Gujarati cookbooks by [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]]. True to form, this is an excellent, informative guide to vegetarian cooking across India that includes over 200 recipes for vegetables (roasted, stir-fried, curry), dals, grains (pilaf, flattened rice, upmas), breads and pancakes, numerous delicious egg and cheese dishes, chutneys, and drinks, sweets and desserts. From what I can tell, &#34;Vegetarian India&#34; appears to be identical (as referenced in the book's title page) but in US measurements, so if you already own &#34;Curry Easy Vegetarian,&#34; you will be getting the exact same recipes. This is a lovely, user-friendly introduction to vegetarian Indian cuisine; highly recommended.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Out of the 20+ Japanese cookbooks I own (including the excellent [[ASIN:1449418295 Japanese Farm Food]] and [[ASIN:1580085199 Washoku: Recipes from the Japanese Home Kitchen]]), this is truly one of the most helpful due to the step-by-step photos and clear explanations. I like that the Japanese names of the dishes are also included (and the meaning  / origins) explained. The technique section is worth the cost of the book alone! You will find an overview of the aesthetics behind Japanese washoku cuisine, kitchen tools, ingredients, traditional table settings and etiquette.<br /><br />Chihiro Masui and Hanae Kaede have done a wonderful job at making Japanese cuisine accessible to the (American) masses. I loved that the authors also differentiated between traditional Japanese cuisine and influence from foreign cuisine. Recipes are divided into six sections (starters, bowls and soups, vegetables and tofu, fried and grilled, rice and noodles, and sweets). Suggestions for readily available substitutions are also provided.<br /><br />For several years, I have tried to master the art of rolling Japanese-style omelettes. I even brought home a gorgeous Japanese iron omelette pan from Japan with no luck, but thanks to the clear step-by-step photos, I finally feel like I'm one step closer to mastering the proper technique to make beautiful rolled omelettes. There are so many fascinating tidbits and tips that have helped me to better understand Japanese food (I took four cooking classes around Japan when I was working there previously in 2011), and I feel that I am a better / more confident home cook for it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone new to Japanese cuisine; the step-by-step photos are truly helpful in understanding the basic preparation of common dishes such as chawanmushi, tamagoyaki, steamed dishes, wagashi, etc.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Stew, bake, braise, poach and roast in the versatile \"Le French Oven\"!',\n",
       "  'text': 'Hillary Davis, author of [[ASIN:142363294X Cuisine Nicoise: Sun-kissed Cooking from the French Riviera]]  and  [[ASIN:1423636988 French Comfort Food]] has created another delicious, accessible guide to French cooking with her latest book “Le French Oven.” This time around, she focuses on using the venerable French oven to create a range of appetizers, soups, baked goods, and braised, roasted, stewed and fried dishes using different sizes of French ovens. Desserts, jams, and drinks are also covered. I was thrilled as soon as I heard from Hillary that her new book centered on French ovens; I easily have over 15 Staub pieces, including eight or nine cocottes ranging from 4-9 quarts, several mini-cocottes, a coq au vin roaster, vertical roaster, wok, and several decorative pieces (pumpkin, tomato).<br /><br />Beginning with a guide to French oven brands (including some familiar names like Staub (my personal favorite), Le Creuset, Revol, Emile Henry, and Mauviel) and how to choose and care for your French oven, there is a delightful user’s guide. Most recipes were created for 5 to 6-quart ovens, but can be adapted for smaller (or larger) ovens. The beauty of French ovens is that they transition seamlessly from stovetop to oven, allowing you to create one-pot dishes that take advantage of searing, braising, baking, roasting and stewing. The cast iron distributes and retains heat beautifully, while cleanup is a breeze.<br /><br />The beautiful photography by Steven Rothfeld will transport you to the cafes, markets, and gorgeous regional architecture of France. Ingredients are given in both US and metric measurements, with ingredients clearly labeled in red. I also appreciated that recipes were broken down into various steps (“prep,” “cook,” “ideas and suggestions”). A list of suggested resources (including retailers and manufacturers of French ovens, table linens, cutlery and glassware) provides a helpful starting point if you are new to the French kitchen.<br /><br />The appetizer section makes use of mini-cocottes, which are perfect for individual portions. Gems include vegetable and feta cheese pot pies, fondue mac and cheese, marinated goat cheese with roasted garlic, and warm mushroom custards with garlic bread.<br /><br />Soups include velvety pumpkin pie, Alsatian beer and munster soup (I substituted a Danish Havarti with caraway and used some Polish rye for the fresh breadcrumbs, which made it a perfect fall / winter dish), and French green lentil and toasted walnut soup (I used a drizzle of toasted walnut oil from France as a final garnish in an homage to the Perigord).<br /><br />Classic French dishes such as beef stew with wine, cassoulet, and whole stuffed and poached chicken with apples and cider sauce are the perfect way to chase fall or winter’s chill from the air. I have poached fish in oil in the slow cooker, but had not attempted the stovetop method; here, poaching salmon in olive oil and Meyer lemons results in a silky, nuanced dish. The super creamy goat cheese vegetable lasagna is the perfect entr&eacute;e for vegetarians, who will also find much to rejoice in with dishes like soft parmesan polenta with arugula salad and poached egg (substitute vegetarian bouillon cubes for the chicken), simply delicious roasted vegetables, braised leeks and Swiss chard with feta and raisins.<br /><br />One technique that I enjoyed learning about was using the French oven to bake no-knead bread; this is the same “no knead” method popularized by Jim Lahey ([[ASIN:0393066304 My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method]]), where dough is baked at high temperatures (450) in a cast-iron pot. The homemade basil garlic loaf is the perfect accompaniment to soups or light salads, while the date and raisin soda bread is the perfect morning treat or teatime pick-me-up.<br /><br />Desserts include a range of custards, poached fruit, crumbles, and puddings, and even jams can be made in a French oven (I loved the fig and Port chutney with crumbly aged cheddar). French ovens can even be used to create a do-it-yourself hot chocolate bar, hot rum punch, and mulled wine – the possibilities are truly endless.<br /><br />Overall, “Le French Oven” is another wonderful addition to my extensive cookbook library (which also includes Hillary’s “Cuisine Nicoise” and “French Comfort Food”), and one that I will find myself using frequently as we slip into winter. Nothing quite dispels winter’s chill like watching the steam curl up from a piping-hot dish served from a beautiful French oven.<br /><br />Merci to Hillary for the review copy and f&eacute;licitations on another marvelous cookbook!',\n",

       "  'title': 'Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!',\n",
       "  'text': 'I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon; I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker,” which introduced me to the joys of making flan, cheesecake, and fruit compote in the slow cooker.<br /><br />Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire, so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors, food consultants, cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog, www.pluggedintocooking.com.<br /><br />As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived, I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes, but also bread puddings, fruits, and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers, bakeware, and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward, and each recipe is followed by helpful tips, making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers, and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker, but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also, perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used, but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick, but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy, but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.<br /><br />The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly, so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly; I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust, spiced pumpkin filling, praline topping), this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.<br /><br />The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney; this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up, so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe, so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe, and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer; the recipe says that it should be thin, but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt, as an accompaniment to Indian food, or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.<br /><br />The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed, but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews, semisweet and milk chocolate chips, a dark chocolate candy bar, and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).<br /><br />Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce, rice pudding with cherries, and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk, German chocolate, ginger-peach, coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake, Southern sweet potato cake, pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.<br /><br />(Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'title': \"Think Southern cooking is just fried, fatty foods? Lighten up, y'all!\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Virginia Willis, French-trained chef at Anne Willan’s La Varenne, is the author of several outstanding cookbooks that merge Southern cooking with French sensibilities (the excellent “Bon Appetit, Y’all” and the follow-up “Basic to Brilliant, Y’all”). In her latest, “Lighten Up, Y’all,” Willis tackles the misconception that Southern comfort food classics like pimiento cheese, mac and cheese, collard greens, fried chicken, and biscuits and gravy are relegated to a dietician’s worst nightmare.<br /><br />Southern cuisine relies on a bounty of fresh produce which can sometimes be hidden under added fats or oils (collard greens, I’m looking at you!), but that doesn’t mean that it’s lacking in any nutritional value whatsoever. Virginia has given these staples a healthier makeover by swapping out full-fat products for lower-fat ones, including applesauce for oil in baked goods, and by substituting a portion of 2% Greek Yogurt (I use 0% Fage) in place of mayo. The best part is that your guests won’t be able to taste the difference; there’s no sense of deprivation or strange textures from using fat-free products (which she doesn’t recommend).<br /><br />Many iconic Southern classics have been given the makeover treatment, including cheese grits, dirty rice, smothered chicken and gravy, and coleslaw. In some cases, recipes are given a French or international treatment (miso-glazed catfish with edamame, rack of lamb with pecan mint dipping sauce). Every recipe includes nutritional info, making it great for those who actively track calories, fat, sugar and carbs. Gorgeous photos tempt you to make every recipe in the book.<br /><br />I recently had the chance to take a “Lighten Up, Y’all” class with Virginia, where we made several recipes from the book including the crab and celery remoulade wraps, makeover broccoli mac and cheese, cider-braised pork loin with apple thyme jus, pan roasted asparagus & mushrooms, buttermilk biscuits, and  Claire’s cream cheese swirl brownies with vanilla cream. She was a most gracious and humorous hostess who exuded Southern charm, and these recipes are sure to be a hit at your next dinner or party.<br /><br />“Lighten Up, Y’all” should belong in everyone’s kitchen; it’s not a “diet” book by any means, but a way to enjoy seasonal vegetables to their fullest without added fat, and to try new produce or meats that you otherwise may have been missing out on (honey mustard Carolina quail with grilled grapes, okra, greens). It’s a wonderful way to enjoy healthier versions of beloved classics without feeling like you’re sacrificing portion size or flavor, and to try new flavors as well.',\n",

       "  'title': 'A gorgeous tribute to the foods of Taiwan',\n",
       "  'text': \"I first learned of Cathy Erway's &#34;The Food Of Taiwan: Recipes from the Beautiful Island&#34; shortly after I found out that I would be in Taiwan for several months for business, so I was excited to delve into this unfamiliar (for me) cuisine. I received my review copy shortly before landing in Taiwan, and took the book with me on a 7,000-mile journey so could use it as a guide as I cooked (and ate) my way around Taiwan.<br /><br />Erway’s book gorgeously captures the essence and nuance of Taiwanese cuisine. Along the way, the recipes are interspersed with history lessons on various aspects of Taiwanese food, food production, and tea culture. An island the size of Massachusetts, Taiwan features a rich cuisine influenced by Chinese regional cuisine as well as Japanese, Dutch, and Portuguese cuisines, and is well known for its tea culture and night markets.  The book opens with the basics of the Taiwanese pantry, sauces and condiments that provide the foundation for later recipes.<br />One of the great pleasures of visiting or living in Taiwan is the huge variety of appetizers and street snacks, including pork belly buns (gua bao), daikon radish pastries (luo bo si bing), tea eggs, potstickers, oyster omelets, and coffin cake. Night markets have their own repertoire of fan favorites such as fried chicken, pork knuckle, fried sweet potato balls, and grilled corn, all of which are chronicled here.<br /><br />Like Chinese cuisine, vegetables hold a starring role and the popularity of organic farming is on the rise in Taiwan. Due to the influence of Buddhism, a large number of Taiwanese are vegetarians, and Taiwanese cuisine features many vegetarian-friendly dishes such as steamed eggplant with garlic and chilies, sautéed mushrooms with ginger, sautéed water spinach, and my personal favorite, the crisp dragon beard fern, which is sold at an organic grocery around the corner from me. Dragon beard fern is a wild green popularized by Taiwan's Aboriginal communities; the greens are blanched then served with a soy-based liquid.<br /><br />Having been vegetarian for more than 10 years and having lived in different Buddhist countries in Asia, I am fairly well-versed in the art of tofu and its many preparations, but I loved Cathy’s recipe for pan-fried tofu with date sauce (gan mei dou fu). Another favorite of mine is stinky tofu; it was one of the first foods I wanted to try in Taiwan, and it didn't disappoint. There is an overview of stinky tofu production and lore on pages 121-124. The stinky tofu cart holds the same mesmerizing appeal that ice cream trucks do for children in the United States, and the pungent odor has the power to stop grown adults in their tracks with anticipation.<br /><br />For those who eat meat, dishes like three cup chicken (san bei ji) and numerous beef, pork and chicken dishes are highlighted, along with preparations for pan-fried fish with peanuts and cilantro, and squid, oysters, clams and shrimp dishes, all of which appear abundantly on local menus. Iconic Taiwanese dishes such as beef noodle soup (niu rou mian), Danzai noodle soup, and pineapple tarts are discussed in detail; you’ll even find a recipe for bubble tea.<br /><br />Gorgeous photography by Pete Lee brings Taiwan’s markets and kitchens to vibrant life. Most appealingly, the recipes in “The Food of Taiwan” are readily approachable by American home cooks and use ingredients that should be widely available at most American supermarkets.<br />“The Food of Taiwan” is a long-overdue paen to Taiwan’s vibrant food and tea culture, which up until now has not been widely written about in the United States. Erway is a wonderful guide; as a Taiwanese-American, she experienced Taiwanese food first through the lens of her immigrant parents in the United States, and later as an exchange student living in Taiwan, when the dishes of her childhood suddenly took on a clarity and depth that was missing.<br /><br />“The Food of Taiwan” is an excellent (and approachable) introduction to this versatile, delicious cuisine and I look forward to cooking my way through it as I travel around Taiwan!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of the publisher)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Lesley Stowe, the creator of one of my favorite snacks Raincoast Crisps, is also a Paris-trained chef who has published several successful cookbooks as well as sharing her tips for cooking and entertaining on shows like Entertainment Tonight Canada and CTV Morning Live. After returning to Vancouver from cooking school in Paris, she noticed that there was a distinct lack of elegant, sophisticated desserts like those found in France and opened a catering business. Her first cookbook, “The Lesley Stowe Fine Foods Cookbook,” was published in 2006, but she had longed to do a cookbook just about desserts.<br /><br />Enter 2014’s “Desserts From My Kitchen.” In addition to all of Lesley’s favorite creations, you’ll also find For Best Results pointers as well as instructional videos on Lesley’s YouTube channel. “Desserts From My Kitchen” is divided into nine chapters including baking basics to cookies, bars, tarts, cakes, dinner party desserts, frozen desserts and holiday favorites. Beginning with the cookies, I loved some of the unusual pairings such as the lime pecan thins, apricot ginger cookies, lemon clove cookies, and winterfruit drops. The stellar and bars deserve special mention, from the caramelly Carmelita bars and very Canadian butter tart bars to the chocolate pecan rum, chocolate, caramel and espresso, apricot almond with white chocolate, and hazelnut anise biscotti.<br /><br />Tarts include French classics such as the tarte tatin to a tropical toasted macadamia coconut tart, papaya passion fruit tart, decadent bittersweet chocolate tart and caramel nut crunch tart with chocolate truffle pastry. Several of the showstopping cakes are also gluten-free (Cracker Queen’s chocolate macadamia nut cake, chocolate date pecan cake with bourbon cr&egrave;me anglaise, Beijing chocolate spice cake). I made the Beijing chocolate spice cake and loved the complex notes from the Chinese five-spice powder (a suggested variation includes cinnamon and chipotle for a Mexican flair); using whole star anise as a garnish makes for a gorgeous presentation. I also appreciated tips for freezing and refreshing cakes as oftentimes I don’t have the time to make a dessert right before the event.<br /><br />The chapter on dinner party desserts will give you a wide range of cobblers, crumbles, puddings, panna cottas and pots de cr&egrave;me to choose from. The semifreddos and frozen desserts offered many fantastic base recipes to experiment with; as a ginger fanatic, I loved the candied ginger and macadamia nut semifreddo, and the chocolate and Gosling’s rum semifreddo. Holiday favorites include festive finales such as drinks (Mexican hot chocolate, chai), cookies (shortbread, rugelach), cheesecakes, tarts, and cakes (yule log, chocolate chestnut torte, fruitcake) that are sure wow guests.<br /><br />Recipes are given in American and metric measurements (American measurements on the left, metric to the right), and I loved that some of the recipes have instructional videos on YouTube on Lesley’s channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCleB4fdPrk_NEjTN9tnIF2Q). Along the way, you’ll learn many French classics such as clafoutis, choux puffs, tarte tatin, a lovely silky lemon curd, ganache and praline. Other basic recipes include cream cheese and chocolate truffle press pastry, sweet tart dough, and almond paste.<br /><br />I found Lesley’s instructions to be straightforward and approachable and appreciated the many tips and optional step-by-step instructional videos on YouTube, which is great for mastering new techniques. I also loved the layout of the recipes (and the inclusion of both metric and American measurements). The end result is restaurant-worthy desserts that combine French techniques, international influence, and nods to comfort baking.<br />“Desserts From My Kitchen” has given me many creative, delicious ways to inspire my baking; with cues from French pastry and technique combined with tropical and nostalgic flavors, it’s a book that is approachable by home bakers (the YouTube videos are particularly helpful for those new to baking) and the desserts will leave a lasting impression on your guests!<br /><br />(Thank you to Lesley and publicist for my review copy!)',\n",

       "  'text': '2015 marks the 10-year anniversary of the stellar Baked: NYC bakery in Red Hook, where classic comfort bakes are given unique twists like chipotle, matcha, and other flavor pairings. This is the fourth cookbook from Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito, the dynamic duo behind Baked: NYC. \"Baked: Occasions\" celebrates a year in desserts, commemorating both well-known and lesser-known holidays (including World Nutella Day, National Pistachio Day and National Wine Day) alongside other festive occasions such as celebrity birthdays (Dolly Parton, Elvis, Hunter S. Thompson, Julia Child). You\\'ll find international influences in their brioche ice cream sandwiches, palmiers, Chinese five-spice sesame scones, brutti ma buoni, Naniamo ice cream bars, and chocolate cinnamon chipotle sugar cookies.<br /><br />A strong sense of the nostalgic runs throughout, including homemade Pop Tarts, fruit crisps, buttermilk, sheet, and pound cakes, and if you think you hate tapioca pudding, wait until you\\'ve tried the chocolate espresso tapioca pudding with Kahlua whipped cream. There are also charming, witty interludes that give more insight into Matt and Renato\\'s upbringing, culinary influences, and traumatic Halloween experiences (and mega kudos for mentioning the Sandra Lee Kwanzaa cake!).<br /><br />\"Baked: Occasions\" also edges into \"fancy\" territory with several showstopping ombr&eacute; cakes and a rainbow-hued icebox cake for Gay Pride (\"somewhere between a semifreddo and a mousse, all chocolaty, whipped-cream heaven - only 100 percent gayer\"). However, the recipes in \"Baked: Occasions\" are often multi-step and perhaps best suited to those who already have some prior baking experience. With the exception of one or two recipes (the purple yam cake calling for ube powder and several calling for food gels), most ingredients should be readily available at your local grocery store.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the Pumpkin Swirl Cheesecake Chocolate Brownies. Now, the Baked brownie has been my go-to brownie for several years since the release of their first cookbook. I\\'ve tried variations such as the Spicy Baked brownie and caramel brownie, but I loved this autumnal variation, which is basically a half brownie recipe topped with a swirl of pumpkin cheesecake goodness. As I was making these for a Halloween potluck, I decided to go all-out and decorate with a Day of the Dead platter and edible marigolds, and the brownies were a huge hit (see photo). They also freeze well, making them a great choice for unexpected company.<br /><br />The second recipe was the Nutella chip cookies, a jazzed-up chocolate chip cookie enhanced with Nutella, chopped toasted hazelnuts, and semisweet chips (I used my gold standard Ghirardelli 60% Chips here). The addition of Nutella gives an extra boost of flavor and moistness. And by all means, try sandwiching two of these beauties together with leftover Nutella as suggested in the Baked Note; you won\\'t regret it! I have plenty of other recipes flagged to try, including the Cheesy Bastille Day Beer Bread, Orange Buttermilk Picnic Cake with Chocolate Chips, and most of the Bundt cakes.<br /><br />I loved the variety on display here (especially the \"12 Days of Cookies\" feature for Christmas that includes traditional European cookies) and playful nature of both the stories and the recipes themselves. Recipes are also enhanced with notes, variations, and storage tips that will allow you to present and store your Baked creations to their full potential.<br /><br />With 65 gorgeous photographs and 75 unique recipes, you\\'ll have everything you need to create a wide range of sweet treats for quirky festivities and traditional holidays all year round. In the words of Matt and Renato, \"Now go enjoy the holidays. Embrace the calendar. Eat Well. Be Sweet.\"',\n",

       "  'text': '“Clean Slate” (from the editors of Martha Stewart Living) is part guide, part cookbook that emphasizes eating clean, whole, unprocessed foods (mostly plant-based), including detox juices and two different “action plans” (a 3-day “jump start” plan and a three-week detox diet). The first 70 pages or so include 11 golden rules, from “practice mindful eating” (Golden Rule No. 3) to “maintain a healthy perspective” (Golden Rule No. 11).<br /><br />Along the way, you’ll learn about good fats (avocado, cold-water fish, nuts), umami-rich flavor enhancers (which lean strongly towards Asian flavors such as miso, nori, and fish sauce), detoxifiers and inflammation fighters, and tips and tricks on incorporating more physical activity, smart shopping, and finding inner balance. The included sample menus are color-coded to show vegan, dairy-free, nut-free and gluten-free recipes at a glance, but my only concern with the sample menus is that the calorie count seems extremely low (each meal only features one recipe and no sides). Basic recipes for stock, harissa, almond milk, etc. are included in the back.<br /><br />The recipes feature simple prep and relatively few ingredients, making them easy to assemble and enjoy. I loved the breakfast options like coconut breakfast pudding with saut&eacute;ed nectarines, honey-caramelized figs with yogurt, crostini with fresh ricotta, cherries, and lemon zest, and breakfast vegetable-miso soup with chickpeas. A large variety of juices and smoothies are also included, along with their respective properties (anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, energizing, hydrating, etc.). There’s a very strong Asian influence with the dashi-poached sweet potatoes and greens ad buckwheat noodles, bok choy, and sweet potatoes and miso-lime broth and the black sea bass with barley, shiitake, and edamame salad, as well as some Middle-Eastern inspired gems like bulgur with pomegranate seeds, a North African chicken-chickpea stew, and Moroccan steamed salmon with quinoa and carrots. There are also Latin- and Mediterranean-inspired dishes, so every member of your family should find something to enjoy.<br /><br />Easy, healthy snacks such as trail mix, roasted edamame with cranberries, sweet potato chips, kale chips, and dried fruit and nut bites are great for school lunches or quick snacks on the go. Several lighter desserts and drinks are also included. Each recipe includes calories, fat, cholesterol, carbs, protein and fiber, although the print is a bit small and it doesn’t jump out at first glance. A thorough color-coded recipe index allows you to quickly plan a menu around dietary needs or plan out weekly menus. There are full-color, full-page photographs for nearly every recipe.<br /><br />Nearly all of the included recipes appealed to me (I frequently cook light Japanese-inspired fish and rice dishes), and I loved the whole grain recipes in particular as I am always looking for ways to jazz up whole grains (the farro and roasted sweet potato salad and quinoa salad with zucchini, mint and pistachios were standouts). Pescetarians will find many great fish dishes, and vegetarians will enjoy the many roasted vegetable salads and variations, although there are few vegan main-course dishes. I found this more valuable for the recipes than the “detox” sample menus, but your mileage may vary. Overall, “Clean Slate” offered many fantastic new recipes to add to my repertoire.<br /><br />(I received this book through Blogging for Books)',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Middle East, which includes several countries that border the Mediterranean, has a long tradition of eating vegetarian. Common Middle Eastern dishes include vibrant fresh salads, dips and breads, as well as a diversity of stuffed vegetable dishes, pilafs, and hearty entrees. Similar to Mediterranean mezze and tapas traditions, smaller dishes are often shared for guests to help themselves. This relaxed and unstructured tradition allows diners to experience a wide range of complementary tastes and textures in a single meal.<br /><br />“New Feast” is the seventh in the Maloufs’ series of award-winning food and travel books focusing on the Middle East, and is the first to be exclusively vegetarian. Greg’s reputation as the creator of a cooking style known as ‘Modern Middle Eastern’ reaches far beyond his native Australia. Lucy’s writing has appeared in compendiums of the best Australian food writing as well as Australian and international newspapers, journals and magazines.<br /><br />As a longtime vegetarian and fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern cooking, I was particularly excited for this release. The recipes in “New Feast” are highly versatile and can be eaten at any meal. Twenty small sections introduce the reader to a wide range of pickles, dips, salads and stuffed vegetables. There are recipes for savory pastries, rice, grains, and breads. The seasoned naans and Middle Eastern pizzas make fantastic snacks or light meals when paired with simple mezze.<br /><br />The dessert section includes ices, sweet pastries, and puddings. The traditional milk pudding muhallabeya is given a chocolate makeover complete with a Turkish coffee granita, while rice pudding is infused with saffron and topped with cardamom-spiced apricots.<br /><br />True to Mediterranean culture, New Feast emphasizes leisurely meals and easy preparations of light and delicious food. Recipes make ample use of olive oil, spices and aromatics common throughout the Mediterranean (garlic, saffron, mint, parsley, basil). Not surprisingly, many of the dishes show clear influence from Mediterranean culinary traditions. There is an excellent Lebanese dandelion, leek, and barrel-aged feta pie that at first glance appears similar to Greek pies such as spanakopita, but the whisper of dried mint and chili flakes lends it a distinctly Middle Eastern flair. The heartier soups feature ingredients which are popular throughout the Mediterranean: the tomato and bean soup with harissa and honey combines thyme, garlic and olive oil with cannellini beans, Italian tomatoes, hard boiled eggs and sourdough bread for a rustic soup that will warm you on the chilliest day.<br /><br />As I frequently tend to eat “breakfast” for dinner, I loved the breakfast offerings of Turkish eggs with spinach, chili, and yogurt cream, as well as Egyptian breakfast beans with feta, lemon oil and green chili relish. These also make a quick light lunch or supper when paired with one of the bread recipes. The first recipe I made was the Turkish milk rolls with yogurt glaze. The soft, pillowy rolls pair perfectly with the flavored butter recipes. I especially enjoyed the apricot-cardamom and the rhubarb, raspberry, and cardamom fridge jam.<br /><br />The jewel-like salads are sure to brighten up any table; the citrus salad with red radicchio and pomegranate dressing and shaved zucchini with grana, burrata and basil are sure to be in my regular rotation.<br /><br />The Maloufs include sample menu ideas for a range of occasions, which will give you plenty of ideas for incorporating the more than 130 recipes into a relaxed gathering in the spirit of Middle Eastern (and Mediterranean) dining. The oversized format and gorgeous photography make this a treat for the eyes as well. In the words of the Maloufs, “however humble the ingredients, Middle Eastern food is always bold and celebratory, fresh and vital and, above all, has an emphasis on flavor and on generosity of spirit.”<br /><br />(This review was originally published on Mediterranean Living's website)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Like many Greeks, Aglaia Kremezi grew up eating mostly vegetarian food: foraged greens, garden vegetables, beans of all kinds, fruity olive oil, and local cheeses and yogurt. Until recently, this was a typical Greek diet; meat was traditionally a rare and expensive commodity reserved for Sundays and holidays (daily meat consumption is still a relatively new phenomenon in Greece) and thus Greeks were mainly vegetarians out of necessity.<br /><br />Kremezi owns a cooking school in Greece called Kea Artisanal, and is the author of the popular “The Foods of Greece” and “Mediterranean Hot and Spicy.” Her newest cookbook “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” contains 150 simple, yet abundantly flavorful, plant-based seasonal dishes from Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, France, and Italy. Sample seasonal menu suggestions offer a wide range of options, including several buffet spreads and one-pot family meals. Recipes are conveniently labeled as vegan and/or gluten-free when applicable, and ingredients are given in American and metric measurements. There is a comprehensive list of online and mail order sources to ensure that you have the necessary ingredients on hand. In the spirit of Mediterranean cuisine, “use only what is freshest and in season;” Kremezi suggests that you “go to your local farmers’ market without a recipe or shopping list in hand, choose the seasonal produce that inspires you, and only then search the pages that follow for a recipe that will showcase your fresh ingredients.”<br /><br />The book begins with a chapter on basic preparations and techniques. Here you will find an arsenal of herbs, seasonings, pickles and preserves that will allow you to quickly transform a dish. You’ll also find an excellent guide to preparing and storing various types of leafy greens. Meze are the star of the show, including dips and spreads, salads, and baked and fried vegetables. If you are planning an all-meze meal (my favorite kind!), start with spreads, pickles, and cold vegetable dishes, then finish with the warm plates. Kremezi suggests serving meze with ouzo or white or rosé wines.<br /><br />In addition to Greek dishes, you’re just as likely to come across a Tunisian dish as a Balkan, Sicilian or Turkish one. Some of my favorite discoveries were the quince stuffed with wheat berries, nuts, and raisins, zucchini rolls stuffed with halloumi, and flatbread with dried figs, Roquefort cheese, and rosemary. The section on breads is excellent, including a homemade version of tortas de aceite as well as a pumpkin, tangerine, and marmalade bread. Desserts include a custardy orange and crumbled phyllo cake, rustic chocolates with dried figs, pistachios and toasted nuts and a quince spoon sweet (I loved the spicy variation infused with ginger, allspice and cayenne).<br /><br />Along the way, Kremezi imparts many fascinating stories into the origins of ingredients and techniques common to Mediterranean cuisines, and the stunning photography by Penny De Los Santos captures fresh produce, ingredients and dishes in a series of vibrant still lifes. The diverse Mediterranean vegetarian (and vegan) dishes featured within are sure to delight even the pickiest eater or devout carnivore. Sadly, all too often vegetarian main courses seem like an afterthought, but the recipes showcased in “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” are certain to become instant classics and bring vegetables and whole grains back into the spotlight where they belong.<br /><br />Whether you are already vegetarian or are simply interested in the Mediterranean diet and eating more healthfully, “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” deserves a place of honor in your cookbook collection.<br /><br />(This review was originally published for Mediterranean Living)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Julian Armstrong has written about food for the Montreal Gazette for more than five decades. As soon as I heard about this book, I knew it was the one for me; I studied abroad for two summers in a French immersion program at Universite Laval in Quebec City and majored in French with an emphasis on Quebec Studies, so La Belle Province has a huge place in my heart. Quebec is a huge land area with great diversity in its landscape and people; some regions are famous for certain products (the nickname “bleuets,” blueberries, is given to people from the Lac-St-Jean area as they grow large amounts of the fruit). Quebec also produces many excellent raw milk cheeses (which are under strict control in other provinces) and maple syrup. Its culinary heritage is strongly influenced by hearty French cuisine preferred by trappers and fur traders. “Made in Quebec” is the author’s second cookbook focusing on the cuisine of Quebec; here she spent several years interviewing cheese makers, mushroom foragers, chefs and farmers, salt cod fishermen, fruit scientists and growers. The book is divided by season and include both staples (poutine, tourti&egrave;re, tarte au sucre, pate chinois) and modern interpretations of traditional flavours. I loved the simple, delicious vegetarian options like the gorgeous Tarte aux tomates confites au sirop d’&eacute;rable et cru du clocher (Tomato Tarts with Maple Syrup) on the cover; in addition to many lamb and pork dishes, there are many fish- and veggie-based dishes to enjoy. The desserts in particular are spectacular.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hillary Davis, author of [[ASIN:1423636988 French Comfort Food]],  is a food journalist, cooking instructor, and creator of the popular food blog, Marché Dimanche, in addition to being a celebrated cookbook author. Davis lived in the village of Bar-sur-Loup, near Nice, for over 11 years. Her culinary initiation into the local cuisine came from village neighbors, friends, cutting-edge chefs, and a host of characters she met along the way. In \"Cuisine Niçoise,\" Davis introduces us in detail to the bright Mediterranean flavors of Nice and the surrounding countryside.<br /><br />Nice was part of the Kingdom of Sardinia until 1860, meaning that its culinary heritage is as much Italian as it is French. Fresh herbs, garlic, olive oil, and the freshest of seafood are prevalent here as they are throughout the entire Mediterranean region. The Italian influence is immediately apparent through polenta, pasta, pizza and risottos. Local cooking is casual, rustic, and dependent upon using the very best of local, seasonal produce. Because of this, it doesn\\'t have the \"fuss factor\" associated with haute cuisine. Another bonus of cuisine niçoise is that it is healthier and more vegetarian-friendly than \"classic\" French comfort food. Swiss chard gnocchi, stuffed vegetables, and ratatouille are much more than side dishes. You can craft an impressive presentation of delicious, eye-catching vegetarian main courses that everyone can enjoy.<br /><br />In Cuisine Nicoise, the recipes open with a gorgeous array of home-cured olives, fresh herb cheese with honey and toast, marinated vegetables and homemade tapenade. Naturally, the venerable salade niçoise (la salada nissarda in local dialect) earns a place of honor, and Davis includes a fascinating history of its development from a simple salad of tomatoes, anchovies, and olive oil to the salad we know and love today. Other tempting salads include a late-August double fig salad with arugula, goat cheese and hazelnuts, as well as an orange, black olive, and gorgonzola salad. Soups include several raw and chilled offerings that are perfect for sweltering summer days, along with traditional pistou and heartier vegetable soups. Vegetables are given their own starring role as a Niçoise zucchini tian, Swiss chard with pears, raisins, and candied garlic, chickpea crepes stuffed with Niçoise ratatouille, and deep-fried vegetables with sage.<br /><br />The section on easy weeknight suppers showcases fresh seafood (I loved the stuffed fresh sardines), one-pan chicken, egg noodles with chicken, anchovies, olives and mushrooms, honey and vermouth-roasted pork tenderloin with fig vinaigrette salad, and swiss chard omelette. Sunday suppers take a little more prep but include drool-worthy dishes like caramelized pork roast with olive jam, Tour de France zucchini pie, pistou tomato tart in a basil crust, and duck with bigarade orange sauce.<br /><br />Desserts deserve special mention. In most Mediterranean countries, desserts feature fresh fruit, Here, fruit is incorporated in new and delicious presentations. A few of my favorites are the frozen fresh fig mousse with white wine caramel sauce, a tasting plate of candied orange peel, chocolate rocks, chestnut candies, peach and raspberry salad with dark chocolate sorbet, fruit and spice cakes, and several lighter-than-air confections.<br /><br />The book\\'s oversized format allows for breathtaking panoramas of Nice and surrounding towns by photographer Steven Rothfeld. As you flip through the pages, you\\'ll be wowed by the bustling Cours Saleya market, beautiful architectural details, the dramatic coastline, and close-ups of market-fresh produce and beautifully plated dishes on colorful ceramics.<br /><br />Part cookbook, part travelogue, \"Cuisine Niçoise\" will take you on a sun-splashed journey to Nice\\'s villages, markets, and festivals with a lively cast of characters, the most vibrant of these being Nice herself.<br /><br />(This review was originally featured on Mediterranean Living - merci to Hillary and her publicist for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Harness your slow cooker to make healthy, delicious meals!',\n",
       "  'text': \"As a fairly recent convert to slow-cookerdom, I've embraced the appliance (Michele Scicolone's three books The French Slow Cooker, The Italian Slow Cooker, and The Mediterranean Slow Cooker are in constant rotation in my house!). I have ATK's Slow Cooker Revolution Volume 2and tried several dishes that I loved. So when I heard that ATK was coming out with a healthy slow cooker book, I knew this was the one for me. I'm pescetarian and follow a low-fat diet, and I knew from previous ATK titles that there were sure to be veggie, grain and fish dishes that appealed to me. When I finally had the chance to flip through &#34;Healthy Slow Cooker Revolution&#34; shortly before New Year's, I'd quickly tabbed dozens of recipes to try. (You can preview the 200 included recipes here: http://slowcookerhealthy.com/full-recipe-list/)<br /><br />In the last two days, I've tried out four recipes from &#34;Healthy Slow Cooker Revolution&#34;: the Spanish tortilla with roasted red peppers, vegetarian pho, poached salmon with caper sauce, and the fingerling potatoes (see photos). Having lived in Spain twice, I've never mastered the stovetop art of the Spanish tortilla and feared it was forever out of my league; even when I tried to cook it on low heat, the bottom ended up scorched and the top was runny. No more! ATK's recipe produced a gloriously thick, hearty tortilla that can be easily cut into squares and served with the optional aioli just like in tapas bars in Spain. The contrast of the bell peppers and the peas makes each slice look like stained glass. I'd tried another vegetarian pho recipe in the past, but I loved the addition of the meaty mushrooms (a mix of fresh portabello and dried shitake) and lemongrass. Instead of veggie stock, I recommend using a carton of Trader Joe's miso ginger broth for an extra dash of umami. The poached salmon was so easy; due to the moist heat and steam, fish turns out moist and flavorful (I've overbaked it and dried it out in the oven previously). The herb relish can be adapted using whatever you have on hand; lacking capers, I used chopped picholine olives and lemon olive oil from Italy. And the fingerling potatoes with lemon were every bit as good as those done in the oven; I loved the addition of lemon peel and lemon juice that gives them a bright pop. I loved the veggie sides like maple-glazed acorn squash and braised butternut squash with pecans and cranberries and the grain mains like farro primavera, wild rice pilaf with cranberries and pecans, and spiced barley pilaf with dates and parsley. Vegetarians are well represented; you'll even find a vegetarian French onion soup and Vietnamese pho. And because this focuses on healthy cooking, desserts are mostly poached fruit and lighter offerings (although you will find two cheesecakes; you can preview the recipe for lemon cheesecake here: http://slowcookerhealthy.com/recipes/lemon-cheesecake/)<br /><br />Comparing the book side-by-side with Slow Cooker Revolution Vol. 2, several things jump out: first, the recommended slow cooker brands have changed dramatically; gone is the All-Clad (which I own), which is missing entirely from the new book. Each recipe now includes nutritional info, and the readability (font and spacing) has changed for the better in the new book: they've switched to a sans serif font and darker print that make it easy to read from a cookbook holder. Each recipe comes with nutritional info as well as a suggested veggie pairing or accompaniment, a very convenient feature since you don't have to flip between sections to find the perfect side dish. There is also more of an Asian influence as there are many Thai-inspired vegetable curries (http://slowcookerhealthy.com/recipes/thai-eggplant-curry/) and soups, tagines, and even a Turkish-style eggplant casserole that I look forward to trying. Recipes are also marked as vegetarian and easy prep.<br /><br />Although shortcut processed foods are absent, there is still some detailed prep required (slicing / mincing veggies, browning meat, microwaving ingredients to parcook them before adding to the slow cooker), so if you are looking for a &#34;dump it and go&#34; book, you may be disappointed. As other reviewers have mentioned, most of these recipes are done in 4-6 hours with the exception of soups, so you can't leave them cooking all day to come back to them in time for dinner (particularly true for fish, which only takes 1 to 2 hours on low). Also, while testing recipes I found that my slow cooker runs a little hot, so be sure to check recipes at the low end of the range first.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Healthy Slow Cooker Revolution&#34; continues the tradition of ATK's last two slow cooker books, allowing you to make a wide range of mains and sides with various international influences. As I am always looking for healthy low-fat vegetarian ideas, I found more recipes in this book that appealed to me than in some of their other slow cooker offerings. Having the nutritional info provided was extremely helpful as well. I loved everything I made and have many more recipes flagged to try in the coming weeks.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Hungarian Kosher family recipes and remembrances...',\n",
       "  'text': '\"Food, Family, and Tradition\" is part memoir, part cookbook, all love. It traces Lynn Kirsche Shapiro\\'s family roots in Czechoslovakia and Hungary and the tragedy of the Holocaust, as well as family dishes that were preserved and handed down for future generations. The book began as Shapiro\\'s way to complete two unfinished legacies: her mother\\'s recipes and her father\\'s autobiography, but along the way became so much more, chronicling the richness of Jewish life in Eastern Europe prior to the Holocaust and the role of faith and strong family traditions that allowed Holocaust survivors to rebuild their lives after the war. The preparations and meals carried an essential ingredient of remembrance that connected them to lost loved ones.<br /><br />The first half of the book traces the author\\'s family roots in Czechoslovakia (her father Sandor Kirsche) and Hungary (her mother Margit) through period photographs, biographies, a family tree of victims and survivors, and original vignettes about Jewish culture, kosher wine, holidays and traditions. Sandor opened Hungarian Kosher Foods (the largest kosher supermarket in the Midwest) in Chicago in 1973 and it still thrives today. More than just an all-kosher supermarket, it has also become a place for the Jewish community to gather and connect.<br /><br />Part two features 150 family recipes from Czechoslovakia and Hungary divided into ten chapters ranging from appetizers and soups to entrees and desserts. All recipes are kosher and marked as parve, meat, or dairy, and Yiddish / Hungarian names are given when applicable. Each recipe is introduced by a family story or the dish\\'s origins, and many contain helpful hints (identified by red dotted boxes). You\\'ll find staples like matjes herring, borscht, and blintzes, but one thing that stood out from my many other Jewish and kosher cookbooks was the inclusion of Hungarian dishes like rakott krumpli, goulash, cabbage with noodles, and fruit soups. I found many new recipes like the sweet bread kugel and golden dumplings that I look forward to making on a regular basis.<br /><br />I own many Jewish cookbooks and have read much on the Holocaust, but \"Food, Family and Tradition\" really resonated with me for several reasons. Many of the recipes evoked those of my Polish grandmother (stuffed cabbage, borscht, kasha, chrain), and my Polish great-grandparents were grocers in 1920s Chicago.  This is a beautiful cookbook that captures the spirit of prewar Czechoslovakia and Hungary\\'s once-vibrant Jewish communities; their legacy lives on through these recipes that have been lovingly preserved and updated for modern kitchens.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Trina Kaye PR)',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Monday Morning Cooking Club is a sisterhood of six friends who have met together every Monday since 2006 to cook together. The six are based in Sydney, but bring with them a wide variety of recipes spanning the globe: Merelyn is from Perth, with Hungarian heritage. Jacqui started her life on the Sydney north shore with an English background. Lisa is from Melbourne, of Polish ancestry. As a child, Lauren immigrated from Pretoria, South Africa. Natanya is a Sydney girl with Shanghai/Russian roots, and Paula is from Durban, South Africa, starting her life in Sydney as a newlywed.<br /><br />At first, their goal was to compile a cookbook to raise money for charity, but it soon became a quest to compile the best recipes from Sydney\\'s best Jewish cooks. Their first cookbook [[ASIN:073229780X Monday Morning Cooking Club]] was released in 2010, and \"The Feast Goes On\" follows largely the same format and is the perfect complement to the first volume, this time expanding the search for recipes to all corners of Australia and beyond.<br /><br />The book opens with a brief \"Kitchen Notes\" section explaining measurements (all recipes were tested using metric measurements, with a metric cup (250ml/ ¾ fl oz) and a teaspoon equal to 5ml). Weighing ingredients is strongly encouraged for the cake, biscuit and pastry recipes.<br /><br />Recipes are divided into Lunchtime, Everyday, Comfort, Feasting, Fressing, and Tradition. Each section features a wide range of culinary influence and the (family) story behind each recipe; you\\'ll find flavors from every corner of the Diaspora, including Middle Eastern salads and pastries, Greek meatballs, Asian-inspired fish, stuffed cabbage rolls, Hungarian favorites like rakott krumpli and goulash, Central Asian dips, and elegant European pastries next to more familiar Ashkenzi favorites (gefilte fish, cholent, blintzes, tzimmes). Gluten-free recipes are marked as applicable, and a glossary lists recipes by type as well as contributor.<br /><br />Beautiful full-page illustrations and photos of the various contributors and their families by photographer Alan Benson bring the recipes to vibrant life; the stories are every bit as much an essential ingredient as the foods they appear next to, stories of \"survival and success, families and friends, loss and recovery; tales of grandmothers and daughters, of mothers and aunts, of fathers and friends.\"  The book\\'s clean layout (I loved the ribbon detail on the page edges) makes it easy to cook from, and I loved that both metric and imperial measurements were retained as I prefer to use the original metric measurements and measure by weight for the best result.<br /><br />This is a beautiful cookbook that I will find myself cooking from frequently, not only for the wide range of international recipes but for the unique stories as well that paint a rich tapestry of the Jewish experience around the globe, brought together in a single Sydney kitchen by a unique sisterhood united by their love of cooking and preserving Jewish food culture for future generations.<br /><br />In the words of the MMCC girls, \"may you and your friends and family feel nurtured, nourished and loved just from the eating. May our stories inspire, engage and move you, and give you a unique insight into our extraordinary community.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Ruth Barnes, known as the Petite Gourmande, brings the rich culinary history of her ancestral homeland to vibrant life in \"Sharing Morocco: Exotic Flavors from My Kitchen To Yours.\" Ruth grew up in Israel on a family farm surrounded by her extended Moroccan family; she learned to cook from the women in the family and would spend the entire day in the kitchen preparing meals for up to as many as 400 people! Ruth reconnected with her Moroccan culinary heritage as an adult living in the United States and now brings Morocco\\'s traditional dishes to American tables.  It\\'s important to note that Moroccan food is not only about the food itself, but also the table settings and presentation.<br /><br />Containing over 100 recipes, you\\'ll find tips and techniques blended seamlessly with Moroccan cuisine, culture, and history. From cooling drinks like almond milk with orange blossom water and watermelon juice cooler with rose water to a lovely fennel and blood orange salad, mixed baby greens salad with figs, and pomegranate salad, these lighter flavorful dishes are perfect for hot summer days, while heartier stews and roasts are perfect for fall and winter.<br /><br />An entire chapter is devoted to the tagine, the conical two-piece earthenware vessel used to create Morocco\\'s spiced meats and bubbling stews. The word \"tagine\" refers to both the cooking/serving dish and the finished dish itself. The many tagines offered here include baked trout stuffed with rice and dates, beef tagine with butternut squash, lamb tagine with apricots and prunes, and seafood tagines.<br /><br />Lamb stars in dishes such as roasted leg of lamb with quince, artichoke hearts stuffed with lamb, Moroccan lamb burgers, and Moroccan-style lamb lollipops with dried fruit couscous. Similarly, there are many wonderful poultry recipes on offer, such as chicken tagine with preserved lemons, olives, and artichokes, duck tagine with figs and port, Cornish hens stuffed with rice, nuts, and dried fruit with apricot sauce, and chicken and rice roulade with apricot sauce. A chapter of seafood includes many stuffed whole fish, a spicy shrimp tagine, Moroccan seafood paella, seafood briouats, and seafood with couscous.<br /><br />Other Moroccan favorites include the flaky phyllo and chicken pie bastilla, briouats (small, filled pastries of crisp phyllo dough), chabakia, sfinges (doughnuts), baghrir, and elegant desserts like a honey and nut briouat, baklava with pistachios and orange blossom water, candied eggplant, and figs stuffed with goat cheese, pistachios, and honey.<br /><br />Ingredient lists are quite manageable, and most ingredients should be readily available at your local store. There is an included recipe for homemade harissa that specifies chile California (dried Anaheim chiles); I appreciated that a specific chile was mentioned, as all too often cookbooks will simply specify \"dried chiles\" without a gauge to spiciness or size. Many of these dishes are simplified from lengthy traditional preparations, which makes it easier to prepare them for weeknight dinners rather than reserving them for special occasions.<br /><br />Along the way, there are family stories, histories about the various dishes, a background into the French and Spanish influence in Morocco, the importance of food and family in Moroccan life, the Maghreb, and Moroccan tea culture. Gorgeous food photography captures beautiful tablescapes with Moroccan glasses and dishes, lanterns, and scenes of everyday life in Morocco. This is truly a gorgeous book and a beautiful tribute to Morocco, but more importantly, it\\'s one I\\'ll find myself cooking from frequently, particularly the Moroccan desserts!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Trina Kaye PR)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ovenly - comfort baking at its finest',\n",
       "  'text': 'Named Best Bakery in New York City by 2013 Time Out New York Food & Drink Awards, Ovenly explores culinary traditions with an unexpected twist, melding salty and sweet with a touch of spice. Their main goal is to provide joy through flavor, and their first cookbook captures this beautifully.<br /><br />Erin (who inherited her mother and grandmother\\'s handwritten recipe cards) and Agatha (a \"refugee in the kitchen\" and daughter of Polish immigrants) have created a warm, approachable book that is full of inviting baked goods and nibbles; their tips, step-by-step photos and clear descriptions mean that any level of baker will be able to tackle these recipes and have them turn out great. I loved reading about Agatha\\'s bilingual childhood where her parents tricked her into eating traditional Eastern European dishes like headcheese and tripe; my Polish grandmother (babcia) used to serve my mother \"chocolate soup\" (czarnina) until the day my mom found out it was actually duck\\'s blood! And like Agatha, my babcia and great-grandmother were masters at Polish baked goods; some of my earliest memories are of helping my grandmother bake in her small apartment kitchen.<br /><br />As I am primarily a (breakfast/brunch) baker at heart, I loved Ovenly\\'s unique take on scones (bloody Mary, cheddar mustard, currant rosemary), quick breads (strawberry basil, citrus berry), and coffee cake (poppy seed, prune, and lemon, banana Nutella). Their cookie flavors are downright revolutionary (mustard spice, bourbon chocolate chip with tarragon, the Stumptown shorty). The melding and blending of complementary flavors continues with their blue cheese apple pie with toasted walnuts, pear, sour cherry and cardamom pie, nectarine, blueberry and vanilla bean rustic tart, caramel bacon hot tarts, and goat cheese, spring onion and chive quiche. I am always on the lookout for spicy brownies that stack up against my standard Baked brownie, and the cinnamon and ancho chile brownies didn\\'t disappoint.<br /><br />In addition to the ample selections of breakfast and brunch bakes, you\\'ll also find a chapter of cakes and cupcakes, including the pistachio cardamom cupcakes with ganache, black chocolate stout cake with salted caramel cream cheese buttercream, and chocolate cheesecake with sour cream topping. And I loved the inclusion of bar snacks (spicy bacon caramel corn, savory rosemary popcorn, maple thyme pecans, and peppery pistachio brittle) that make the perfect nibbles with cocktails or drinks.<br /><br />One thing that did surprise me as an experienced home baker was their note on weighing ingredients: \"As we sent out our recipes for testing, we heard from friends, colleagues and family that none of them used the weight measurements we had provided. So, we decided not to use them in our book unless we felt it was necessary for a recipe.\" Instead, they have created a somewhat lengthy conversion chart at the front of the book. Normally I bake solely by weight assuming it is provided as I find it to provide more accurate, consistent results (especially true with flour, which changes weight depending on humidity and other factors); I wish they had just left that in for anyone who is so inclined, but that\\'s my personal preference.<br /><br />I loved some of the more unique advice like filing scratch marks into an aluminum or steel pan in order to aid with cutting finished brownies, bars, and shortbread that I haven\\'t seen mentioned in my other baking books. The \"Get Creative\" sidebars marked with rolling pins will give you addition suggested variations to play with; you\\'ll find cornflake topping for muffins, cashew butter and cayenne pepper filling for coffee cake, and nods to Eastern European pastries (jelly-filled muffins that brought to mind the paczki we eat on Mardi Gras, lemon poppyseed prune cake).<br /><br />Whether you\\'re already a fan of Ovenly (for those lucky enough to live in New York) or simply love delicious baked goods with unusual twists, Ovenly deserves a spot of honor in your cookbook collection!<br /><br />(Thank you to Agatha and Erin for the advance copy - dziêkujê bardzo!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Johnny Iuzzini, winner of the James Beard Award for Outstanding Pastry Chef and recognized as one of the 10 Most Influential Pastry Chefs in America by Forbes, delivers a home run with his second cookbook. \"Sugar Rush\" (with an introduction by Dorie Greenspan) is a fantastic primer for all aspiring pastry chefs and home bakers. Approachable and gorgeously photographed, each chapter opens with a mother recipe complete with step-by-step photos demonstrating the proper technique, then you are given numerous opportunities to try out your new skills on a tempting array of desserts in the same family.<br /><br />Every major type of dessert base is covered in gorgeous photography and step-by-step guides, from caramel, custards and marshmallow to yeast and laminated doughs, cookie and tart doughs, and glazes, frostings, fillings and sauces. Johnny\\'s pastry cream flavors were particularly inspired; pi&ntilde;a colada, coffee cardamom, tarragon vanilla and blackberry pastry creams mean that you\\'ll never lack inspiration for a cream puff or &eacute;clair filling. And his primer on meringue includes French, Swiss and Italian meringues as well as sabayon, semifreddo, and mousse.<br /><br />His flavor combinations are appealing and inventive, including banana fritters with tahini caramel cream, chocolate sesame seed cake, and a root cake features parsnips and carrots. One of the standouts for me was his apricot custard tart, made with almond flour and pistachios. Impressive yet fairly straightforward to assemble, this is a showstopping dessert made with a few simple ingredients. Another similarly French tart is the gorgeous strawberry-tarragon tart, inspired by a fraise des bois tart while Johnny was working at Ladur&eacute;e in Paris under Chef Pierre Herm&eacute;. I\\'m also eager to make the double-crust caramel-walnut tart for the holidays; a variation of the Swiss Engadiner, an almond-enriched tart dough surrounds a filling of caramel and walnuts.<br /><br />As a diehard ginger lover (I eat candied ginger straight out of the bag), I loved the ginger-curry sugar cookies, and the play date cookies brought to mind the mamoul my Iraqi students used to bring to class. The addition of a spiced filling (cloves, cinnamon) was a welcome addition to what is traditionally a very sweet filling. Another instant favorite is the spicy malted chocolate chipotle brownies; dense and fudgy, a sprinkling of Demerara sugar lends crunch, while chipotle, smoked paprika, and cayenne provide a hit of heat and depth.<br /><br />I own nearly 50 pastry and baking books, including several professional pastry textbooks, and I can say with absolute certainty that I will find myself coming back to \"Sugar Rush\" again and again for its winning combination of clear explanations and photographs and appealing recipes. Unlike some other pastry books I own, you will not have to seek out expensive, hard-to-find ingredients (no gold leaf/dust, powdered ube, or molecular gastronomy required!) to end up with showshopping desserts, and the solid foundation on basic pastry techniques will serve you well on your future baking adventures.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in baking / pastry, this is one book you need to have in your collection. Or as Johnny succinctly puts it, \"Once you grasp some fundamentals, you are limited only by your imagination.\" Happy baking!<br /><br />(Review copy provided by Blogging for Books)',\n",

From beef and Guinness and chicken tortilla soup to fish tacos, lamb and peas, to octopus chips, you'll find sweet and savory ideas from around the globe.<br /><br />Ingredient lists are short and prep is fairly straightforward and unfussy; however, some of the dishes call for specialty ingredients (particularly fresh seafood) that may not be easy to come by (octopus sashimi, ahi tuna). I loved the unusual flavor profiles of the desserts in particular, including the London Fog tea cake and figs and cheese cheesecake. As a vegetarian, there were several Asian recipes that appealed to me (tofu fries, miso eggplant, baked mac and cheese (I added Italian-seasoned panko on top and am glad I did as the dish needed the extra crunch). Ingredients are given in American and metric measurements, and each recipe has a beautiful full-page photograph.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, taste is highly subjective, and very few of the mains here caught my eye (many Latin and Asian meat-based recipes). Many recipes rely heavily on seafood (fish pie, fish tacos, clam boil, fried oysters, octopus chips).<br /><br />For those who are fairly new to the kitchen, open to new flavor combinations and profiles, and are looking to gain more experience in technique, &#34;Easy Gourmet&#34; would be a great choice; however, if you already have a large cookbook collection, it's likely that you already have many similar recipes in other cookbooks.\",\n",

Many of us are only familiar with the heavy, cream-laced dishes in Indian restaurants, but Rinku\\'s goal is to show that Indian cooking is more about flavors, freshness and love. Her emphasis on fresh, local ingredients (preferably from your own backyard, farmer\\'s market, or CSA) and sustainability pair beautifully with Indian spices and simple, nourishing preparations that will delight family and friends.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed and printed in the USA, the book begins with several short primers to sustainability in the Indian kitchen and learning the essentials (spices, oils, tools). Unlike some Indian cookbooks, \"Spices and Seasons\" does not require a long list of exotic imported cookware, and many of the ingredients should be readily available at larger grocery stores. Each recipe has a vibrant, full-color photo illustrating it.<br /><br />Beginning with appetizers, you will find many great ideas that come together quickly. Some standouts include the mango and goat cheese mini crisps, shortcut vegetable samosas, chicken tikka and almond and saffron salmon kabobs. The remainder of the recipes are grouped by season; not surprisingly, there is a whole chapter of lentil and bean-based recipes, several of which are prepared in the slow cooker. I loved the comforting slow-cooked chickpeas with tomatoes and ginger (I used chipotles in adobo since that was what I had on hand) and the egg curries as I am always looking for new ideas to incorporate hard-boiled eggs.<br /><br />Each recipe is prefaced with a brief introduction to its region, family history, and handy tips that will ensure a great result every time. Simple, flavorful preparations make the most of seasonal ingredients. I loved the tandoori spice roasted baby potatoes with mint, broccoli with toasted cashew nuts, the autumn dishes for shrimp in a mango basil sauce and salmon with a blood orange and tamarind glaze, and rich coconut curries. Other meats are featured, but the seafood section really shines. One of my favorite discoveries was the Japanese-inspired wasabi ginger fish with fresh blackberries; the sweetness of the maple syrup and blackberries offsets the umami of the soy sauce and the pungency of the ginger.<br /><br />Chapter nine features pilafs and grains, which oftentimes are a main meal for me. There is also a chapter featuring traditional breads and crepes like naan, puri, dosas, and oothapams that take the mystery out of homemade breads to accompany your Indian feasts. Desserts are on the lighter side, and many feature fruit or fruit ices.<br /><br />Several basic wet and dry spice blends are also included (chaat masala, tandoori masala, garam masala, curry powder) that give a much different, more vibrant flavor to your finished dish than using bland premixed blends from a grocery store and it is well worth investing the extra time to make up these mixes in advance.<br /><br />In addition to being very suitable for vegetarians and pescetarians (there are many meat-free options and appealing seafood recipes), there is a gluten-free and vegan/vegetarian index and all recipes are also marked as vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free.<br /><br />This is one of those rare cookbooks that I am compelled to cook my way through cover to cover; I have not had the pleasure of reading / cooking from Rinku\\'s first book \"The Bengali Five Spice Chronicles,\" but based on my experience with \"Spices and Seasons,\" it will be next on my list!<br /><br />Verdict: \"Spices and Seasons\" is an absolute must-own for anyone who enjoys Indian food or is simply looking for simple, healthful ways to make the most of an abundance of garden vegetables or a CSA box.<br /><br />Thank you to Rinku for the review copy!',\n",

       "  'title': 'We can all stand to learn a thing or two about eating and living well from Ikaria!',\n",
       "  'text': 'As a vegetarian/pescetarian, Greek food has long appealed to me. Two of my favorite Greek cookbooks are [[ASIN:0312200765 The Greek Vegetarian: More Than 100 Recipes Inspired by the Traditional Dishes and Flavors of Greece]]and [[ASIN:0688175112 Meze: Small Plates to Savor and Share from the Mediterranean Table]], both by Greek-American cookbook author Diane Kochilas. Kochilas has written nearly 20 books on Greek and Mediterranean cuisine and is a collaborating chef at Molyvos in New York. Her cooking philosophy is rooted in the tenets of the Greek-Mediterranean Diet: keep it simple, respect seasonality, use ingredients that have integrity and are easy to find, eat lots of greens and vegetables, share, and finally, the golden rule - Nothing in Excess.<br /><br />So I was super-excited to see that Kochilas had a new cookbook coming out that focuses on the cuisine of Ikaria, her ancestral homeland and the location of her cooking school Glorious Greek Kitchen. Kochilas has devoted her life to promoting the natural, healthy and delicious foods of Greece.. Her new book \"Ikaria: Lessons on Food, Life, and Longevity from the Greek Island Where People Forget to Die\" chronicles the wisdom and food traditions of generations of Ikarians. More than just a collection of excellent recipes, this is a unique glimpse into an island where time seems to stand still and the worries and stresses of modern life melt away.<br /><br />Ikaria is one of the world\\'s Blue Zones, a place where inhabitants reach age 100 at rates 10 times greater than in the United States. The organic, unprocessed diet of Ikarians, as well as regular physical activity, laid-back attitude, and arguably nonexistent relationship with time (shops around the island read \"Clocks, Anxiety and Stress Have No Place on Ikaria\") are likely all contributing factors. Kochilas\\' interviews with Ikaria\\'s octogenarians and above reveal a positive attitude and joy for life that we can all learn from.<br /><br />After an introduction explaining the Blue Zones, The Ikaria Study and the rhythms of traditional Ikarian life, the delicious recipes begin. In keeping with the unprocessed foods of Ikaria, most recipes call for only a handful of ingredients. There are instructions for making homemade goat cheese, homemade phyllo dough, and for drying vegetables for preservation. The chapter on salads features a very thorough lexicon of edible greens and wild herbs, including medicinal uses. Along the way, sidebars provide more in-depth info on particular ingredients, techniques, and local festivals.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, vegetables play a starring role in this book. An entire chapter devoted to using vegetables as a main course includes baked, stewed, braised, and stuffed veggies that will give you plenty of creative ideas for how to make the most of the season\\'s bounty. One of my favorite discoveries was a delicious variation on stuffed grape leaves using collard greens and dried corn. The chapter on savory pies and breads includes a recipe for homemade phyllo, spanakopita and stuffed pies, fried hand pies, and skillet puffs and griddle pies.<br /><br />Ikarians are blessed with an abundance of fish and seafood, which is integral to the Ikarian diet. Small fish are fried, while large fish are generally grilled, baked, or made into soup. Meat is \"consumed regularly but sparingly, more as a condiment than as a main-course protein,\" according to the author. Goat meat is the most popular meat on Ikaria, and you\\'ll find several wonderful, unfussy preparations here including baby goat braised with fennel, oregano-roasted goat, and baby goat with yogurt avgolemono that are the perfect introduction to this versatile staple.<br /><br />In addition to making several of the mezedes (including the whipped feta spread), I loved the lentil salad with fennel, onions, and lots of herbs; the touch of mint and dill gave an unexpected brightness to the lentils. I opted for a lemon-infused olive oil as I thought it would pair well with the fresh herbs (many of the legume recipes in the book call for a splash of lemon juice). I absolutely adored the baked zucchini fritters with oregano and mint and appreciated that several of the fried recipes also included lighter baked alternatives. As a sweet finale, I baked the spice cake for the revealing saint (fanouropita) in a decorative Bundt pan -- it makes the perfect afternoon treat with a cup of Greek coffee.<br /><br />Sprinkled throughout the book are gorgeous portraits of Ikaria\\'s landscape and architecture, Ikarians engaged in daily activities and festivals, and mouthwatering food photography. The book is rounded out with resources, including a bilingual Greek/English bibliography, and a very handy metric conversion chart that also features pan sizes. Recipe names are given in English and transliterated Greek.<br /><br />This is a fabulous addition to your Mediterranean cookbook library and a wonderful introduction to regional Greek cooking. We can all stand to learn a thing or two about eating and living well from Ikaria!<br /><br />(This review originally appeared on Mediterranean Living as the October spotlight review)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Over the years, I\\'ve bought / tested many America\\'s Test Kitchen / Cook\\'s Illustrated titles, most of which are in frequent rotation in my kitchen. I was excited to see \"The Make Ahead Cook,\" as I rarely have time to cook during the week and try to have everything prepared on the weekend. I\\'ve been vegetarian / pescetarian for over 10 years, and one of the things I like about America\\'s Test Kitchen is that their books usually include a decent number of vegetarian mains / sides that I enjoy making.<br /><br />When I received \"The Make Ahead Cook,\" I eagerly flipped through it...only to find nothing that I was interested in making. The majority of the recipes are meat-based, and those veggie options that were included simply didn\\'t sound appetizing. Many recipes use store-bought shortcuts. One of the few recipes that did look interesting, eggplant and soba noodles, included barbeque sauce in addition to soy sauce; I\\'ve lived in Japan and took four cooking classes there, and I find it hard to fathom why it was added to what would have otherwise been a tasty Japanese-inspired noodle dish.<br /><br />The book focuses on eight strategies for making ahead: Prep Ahead, Reheat and Eat, Bake and Serve, From Fridge to Table, Shop Smart, The Sunday Cook (this section focuses on leftovers), Come Home to Dinner (slow cooker recipes), and Stock the Freezer. I was happy to see a chapter on slow cooker recipes as I own [[ASIN:1936493578 Slow Cooker Revolution Volume 2]], but again none of the recipes here appealed to me the same way that their other slow cooker titles have.<br /><br />Despite being billed as \"make ahead\" and the use of some store-bought shortcuts, many recipes are not quick to make, requiring multiple steps / stages and rest times in some cases. As is common with ATK / Cook\\'s Illustrated titles, you will find many photographs and sidebars containing helpful tips and tricks.<br /><br />Unfortunately \"The Make Ahead Cook\" missed the mark for me; the combination of meat-heavy recipes and involved prep means I won\\'t be reaching for this as often as my other ATK titles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Indian cuisine is my culinary final frontier; for many years, I\\'ve collected Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Asian cookbooks, but didn\\'t have any in my collection that focused on the varied foods of India. I recently purchased [[ASIN:0761165215 Indian Cooking Unfolded: A Master Class in Indian Cooking, with 100 Easy Recipes Using 10 Ingredients or Less]] and reviewed [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]], gradually easing my way into various Indian regional cuisines.<br /><br />So I was excited as soon as I heard that Ten Speed Press was bringing out an Indian slow cooker book to complement their other slow cooker titles and have eagerly been awaiting its release (note that this book is NOT related to [[ASIN:1572841117 The Indian Slow Cooker: 50 Healthy, Easy, Authentic Recipes]]). As soon as I received \"New Indian Slow Cooker,\" I read it cover to cover and marked several recipes to try. There is a pretty even balance between meat/seafood dishes (15 curries) and vegetarian options (11 veggie dishes and 11 dals). Many of the rice dishes are also vegetarian. There are also several \"out of the cooker\" recipes for sides, including chapattis, homemade yogurt, kachumber, raita, chutneys, paneer and a spice blend.<br /><br />The book includes a very compact guide to Indian spices and ingredients; a few photos or illustrations would have been helpful here for those new to Indian cuisine, but there is detailed info (and Hindi names) for each ingredient. One thing I would have appreciated was knowing what ratio of dried curry leaves equal fresh, as that was all I was able to source in my area (the recipes call for a specific number of fresh leaves).  One trick I started using was a bouquet garni bag; this easily allowed me to remove the bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, etc. at the same time without having to hunt around the slow cooker.<br /><br />My all-time favorite discovery here was the mixed dried fruit chutney; I can\\'t stop eating the stuff! I\\'ve been using it on yogurt, as a sandwich spread, and I find myself sneaking back to the fridge with a (clean) spoon for another taste. You can mix and match whatever dried fruit you have on hand. This would go splendidly with turkey and squash as it has a strongly autumnal taste due to the fresh ginger and cloves. I also tried the Kerala fish curry (with the shrimp option), dum aloo, and channa masala.<br /><br />Recipes call for you to put the slow cooker on high for 15 minutes before beginning to warm the insert. Because I have an insert that can go on the stovetop, I accomplished frying and cooking in the same insert. One thing I really liked was that most recipes were tested in a 6-quart slow cooker (I have two); many times, cookbooks are scaled for a much smaller cooker and I never know how to adjust the times accordingly, but everything I tried from \"New Indian Slow Cooker\" meshed with the times in the book.<br /><br />I was able to source most of the ingredients at my local store without having to go to the local Middle Eastern market or mail order them (not true for other Indian cookbooks I\\'ve tested). Ingredients and instructions are straightforward, and prep time is generally low (other than preparing the tadka or masala). There are photos for every two or three recipes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good first introduction to Indian cuisine; the slow cooker is a natural for the many dishes that take advantage of braising, particularly dals and veggie curries, and Neela Paniz walks you through each recipe with a story or origin for each dish. I will certainly find myself turning to \"New Indian Slow Cooker\" the next time I am in the mood for Indian (and to keep a stash of the mixed dried fruit chutney on hand!)<br /><br />(Review copy from Blogging for Books)',\n",

       "  'title': \"Recipes from the world's best-loved Jewish chefs, proceeds go to charity = win-win!\",\n",
       "  'text': 'It is no secret that food plays an enormous part in Jewish identity and celebration. Gefiltefest is a British Jewish food charity whose mission is to bring people together to explore the relationship between Judaism and food, educating and enthusing them about all aspects of Jewish food including food heritage, ethics, culture and traditions. The charity is proud to be at the forefront of Britain\\'s Jewish food movement and stages a hugely popular annual festival.<br /><br />To coincide with the 2014 festival, Gefiltefest has produced its first-ever Jewish cookbook. This engaging book includes contributions from well-known Ashkenazi and Sephardi chefs and food writers from around the globe. Over a three-year period, more than 65 chefs donated recipes, including Poopa Dweck ([[ASIN:0060888180 Aromas of Aleppo: The Legendary Cuisine of Syrian Jews]]), Jamie Geller ([[ASIN:0062207822 Joy of Kosher: Fast, Fresh Family Recipes]]), Joyce Goldstein ([[ASIN:0811819698 Cucina Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish Kitchen]]), Deborah Madison, Joan Nathan ([[ASIN:0375402764 Jewish Cooking in America: Expanded Edition (Knopf Cooks American)]]), Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi ([[ASIN:1607743949 Jerusalem: A Cookbook]]), Claudia Roden ([[ASIN:0394532589 The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York]]), Gil Marks ([[ASIN:0684835592 The WORLD OF JEWISH COOKING: More Than 500 Traditional Recipes from Alsace to Yemen]]), Tina Wasserman ([[ASIN:0807411108 Entree to Judaism: A Culinary Exploration of the Jewish Diaspora]]), Paula Wolfert ([[ASIN:0061957550 The Food of Morocco]]) and Orly Ziv ([[ASIN:9659207107 Cook in Israel: Home Cooking Inspiration]]). This unique cookbook features their favorite recipes, encouraging the use of seasonal produce. The proceeds from the compilation will be donated to Gefiltefest, the only British charity that has Jewish culinary tradition as its primary focus and believes in proudly enjoying Jewish heritage and keeping culinary traditions alive.<br /><br />The book begins with an introduction by founding patron Claudia Roden and a foreword on \"Being refined, heimische and hygienic: Early Jewish cookery books\" by Maureen Kendler. Beginning with starters, soups, salads, light dishes and dips, you\\'ll find familiar elements like borscht on the rocks (dairy or parve) and chicken soup with handmade egg noodles alongside Sephardic and Middle Eastern dishes like smoky eggplant salad with garlic and parsley, Moroccan orange and olive salad, tabouleh-couscous vegetable salad and Paula Wolfert\\'s Tunisian couscous with fennel, red peppers and garlic. There are many delicious \"upscale\" salads that have made it into frequent rotation in my kitchen, particularly Tina Wasserman\\'s arugula salad with dates and chevre and Evelyn Rose\\'s chicory and frisee salad with blue cheese, croutons and pecans.<br /><br />Mains offer a variety of stellar chicken dishes like Simi Goldberg\\'s roasted paprika chicken, white rice with nut and raisin topping and the Italian Jewish chicken with tomatoes, olives, herbs and red wine, while lamb dishes also get ample coverage (sumac rack of lamb with fattoush salad, Greek lamb stew with romaine lettuce and dill, spring lamb casserole). As I am pescetarian, I particularly loved the fish offerings, particularly the salmon with noodles and leeks, oodles of spring onions with cod in a ginger and soy sauce, deconstructed sushi salad platter, and dill salmon. Fellow vegetarians will also find much to enjoy, such as the pumpkin, spinach and feta frittata with piperade, caprese latkes, springtime risotto, veggie bakes, and the amazing egg-stuffed crispy brik pastry with feta, caramelized shallots and spinach served with date syrup and a herb salad. (Note that veggie dishes are listed under \"mains\" and there is not a separate veggie section.)<br /><br />Desserts offer a festive assortment of Eastern European favorites like strudel, compote, babka, kugel, lekach, rugelach, and cheesecake alongside Middle Eastern sweets like cornes de gazelle filled with marzipan, orange and anise glazed sweet potato sfinge, stewed black grapes and Greek yoghurt, and Syrian apricot compote in rosewater syrup.<br /><br />Each recipe is labeled dairy, meaty, or parve, and ingredients are given in metric and volume. There is a brief introduction by each author to the origin of a given recipe, sometimes including bits of family history as well. The recipes are delicious, unfussy, and include a wide range of culinary influences from the Jewish diaspora, and it is wonderful to hear from so many well-known Jewish chefs in a single place (I own many of their individual cookbooks). There are the occasional full-color photos, but not for every recipe. I appreciated the fact that the book is printed on high-quality matte pages, so glare is not an issue. I also liked the page layout being broken up by blocks of color (green horizontal bars for the recipe title, the contributing author\\'s name in a red vertical bar on the page edge).<br /><br />Overall, the Gefiltefest Cookbook is a wonderful addition to your cookbook collection, not only for the recipes but for the fact that proceeds go to charity.

       "  'text': \"Much like his groundbreaking Plenty: Vibrant Recipes from London's Ottolenghi, Jerusalem once again finds Yotam Ottolenghi (and Sami Tamimi) exploring fabulous marriages of tastes, textures and colors inspired by the Middle East. Here, Jerusalem is the backdrop for a love song to the city's cuisine. Despite the historical tension between the city's Arab and Jewish residents, there are marked similarities in their respective cuisines (cucumber and tomatoes in an Arab / Israeli salad, kebabs and kibbeh, stuffed and pickled vegetables). Centuries of Jewish immigration by various Jewish populations loan a wealth of flavor profiles unique to their respective traditions (if you're looking for kosher recipes, there are discussions on kosher cooking, but read the ingredients to make sure; the lamb meatball recipe calls for yogurt as a topping).<br /><br />You'll find recipes inspired by Jerusalem's local fruits and vegetables, including the fabulous roasted sweet potatoes and fresh figs, with its hint of heat from red chile and tartness from goat's milk cheese and balsamic vinegar, roasted butternut squash and red onion with tahini and za'atar, or the Swiss chard with tahini, yogurt and buttered pine nuts. There is a whole chapter devoted to stuffed vegetables, including such gems as lamb-stuffed quince with pomegranate and cilantro, stuffed eggplant with lamb and pine nuts, and stuffed artichokes with peas and dill.<br /><br />Meat plays a starring role, largely variations on chicken, lamb and the occasional veal, but you'll also find pan-fried sea bass with harissa and rose petals, olive oil-poached tuna, and salmon steaks in chraimeh sauce. Vegetarians will delight in the savory pastries; my favorite was the red pepper and baked egg galettes and the labor-intensive (but worth it) herb pie. You'll even find Georgian mainstay khachapuri enhanced with halloumi and feta.<br /><br />Finally, the sweet end to the meal: like many Middle Eastern cuisines, the desserts in Jerusalem lean toward desserts soaked or brushed with sugar syrup, including sweet filo cigars, the goat-cheese-sweetened mutabbaq, semolina, coconut and marmalade cake. European influence is evident in the beautiful, insanely addictive spice cookies studded with dark chocolate, lemon zest, orange zest, and a variety of spices, which have their roots in Germany and Italy. The showstopping chocolate krantz cakes take more than a day to make, but are well worth the effort.<br /><br />Recipes are given in American and metric measurements in a large, easy-to-read font (ingredients are written in bold). Each recipe has an introduction with a brief history of the dish's origin or a personal memory from Yotam (who grew up in Jewish West Jerusalem) or Sami (who grew up in Muslim East Jerusalem).<br /><br />The lavish photographs of Jerusalem's Arab and Jewish markets and restaurants are as much a feast for the eyes as the gorgeous photos of recipes, whether it's a shelf of hookah pipes, a group of elderly friends playing backgammon, or yellowed family photos. Along with the recipe backstories, these candid portraits really bring the city to life.<br /><br />This is a beautiful tribute to Jerusalem, a unique culinary and cultural crossroads. The focus continues the strong flavor and texture pairings in Yotam's previous cookbook Plenty: Vibrant Recipes from London's Ottolenghi, which is still a mainstay in my kitchen. The vast majority of ingredients should be easy enough to come by in a large supermarket, and the results, like Plenty, are simply amazing. Jerusalem gets my vote for top cookbook of 2012, and I don't doubt it will be nominated for the James Beard and IACP awards.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ten Speed Press)\",\n",

       "  'title': 'A healthy, colorful taste of Israel perfect for any level of home cook',\n",
       "  'text': 'Winner of the 2013 Gourmand Award: Best First Cookbook and Best Cookbook Photography, the beautiful \"Cook in Israel: Home Cooking Inspiration\" will lead you on a colorful journey through (kosher) Israeli cuisine. Packed with delicious, easy to follow recipes, \"Cook in Israel\" draws on the author\\'s Jewish-Greek heritage and the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors of her Tel Aviv home. Orly has been offering popular cooking classes and culinary tours of Israel since 2009. \"The culinary tours are a way to introduce tourists visiting Israel, who are excited by the freshness of the vegetables and fruits here and create a way to bring visitors closer to our food,\" Orly explains.<br /><br />Filled with 100 (mostly vegetarian) recipes, many with step-by-step photos, cooking from \"Cook in Isreal\" is like taking a personal class with Orly. Most of the recipes take 30 minutes or less to prepare, making them perfect for weeknight dinners. Recipes for Jewish holidays are included. A former clinical nutritionist, Orly\\'s recipes are healthy, flavorful and easy to prepare. The recipes in the book reflect the way Orly\\'s family cooks and eats and are inspired by her mother and grandmother, the local shuk (market) and by all the cultures that have come to Israel.<br /><br />Given Orly\\'s Greek / Sephardic heritage, it\\'s not surprising to see many dishes with eggplant featured prominently (baba ghanoush, eggplant baladi, Turkish-style eggplant, roasted eggplant, Greek-style eggplant salad, eggplant with Bulgarian cheese, eggplant siniye, etc.). I really appreciated the many creative (and tasty) ways to use this versatile fruit (eggplant is technically a large berry).  I also loved the many refreshing salads (raw beet and apple, orange and fennel, cabbage and cranberry salad, carrot and pecan salad, parsley, nuts, and feta cheese salad) and the green shakshuka, which I had not seen before. The book\\'s photography by Katherine Martinelli deserves special mention; all the photographs were shot in Orly\\'s home.<br /><br />I\\'ve made several of the recipes in \"Cook in Israel\" including several salads, a fish recipe, a sweet bread recipe and a cookie recipe. Each recipe is prefaced with a short history of a dish (or a food memory attached to it).  Although I love salmon, I\\'d never tried preparing it at home.  After making Orly\\'s salmon baked with mustard and honey (only three ingredients - salmon, mustard and honey), I\\'m no longer intimidated by cooking fish at home and can\\'t wait to try some of the other recipes like fish with green tahini sauce and the fish kebabs with yellow tahini yogurt sauce.<br /><br />I also made the Bukharan chickpea pastry, and I loved her simple take on the Sephardic mainstay borekas using puff pastry dough (since these are already dairy, I prefer to use French puff pastry made with butter, such as Dufour, instead of Pepperidge Farm, which is pareve). I loved the dairy dishes like baked pasta for Shavuot.<br /><br />I made the chocolate halvah babka and the date and walnut pinwheel cookies from the sweets chapter; the step-by-step photos were a huge help for figuring out how to cut and braid the babka (I\\'m used to making three-strand challahs, but trying to braid a two-strand rope was trickier!). The date and walnut cookies reminded me of ones my Iraqi students would bring to class; I loved the touch of rosewater and spices in the filling and dough.<br /><br />Naturally, the biggest challenge (depending on your local supermarket) will be sourcing some of the ingredients such as date spread, date honey (silan), halvah, rosewater, etc. called for, but these are mostly found in the sweets chapter and can easily be located online. You can also make your own date spread at home by cooking pitted Medjool dates and a little water until it cooks down to a thick paste, which is what I did when I tried this recipe as I had a surplus of Medjool dates to use up!<br /><br />One additional observation is that like some other Israeli cookbooks I\\'ve seen, the amount of a given ingredient may be up to the chef (a recipe will say \"diced olives,\" or \"chocolate spread\" with no recommended amount), or there are no detailed instructions for a given step (\"roast the eggplants under a broiler\" with no recommended temp/ time), but most recipes include very simple instructions and uncomplicated ingredient lists that make these perfect for a quick weeknight dinner.<br /><br />This is a wonderful introduction to vegetarian-friendly Sephardic and Israeli cuisine (the book is largely pescetarian / vegetarian with a couple of meat-based recipes); the recipes are appealing, full of fresh herbs and veggies, simple to put together, and there are plenty of tips and step-by-step photos that make \"Cook in Israel\" perfect for any level of chef. My next goal will be taking one of Orly\\'s \"Cook in Israel\" cooking classes and tours in Israel!<br /><br />You can find more info on Orly\\'s culinary tours and cooking classes at http://www.cookinisrael.com/<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of the author)',\n",

       "  'text': 'A baker since a young age, Victoria Glass is an expert cake maker and owner of Victoria\\'s Cake Boutique. The author of [[ASIN:184975263X Boutique Wedding Cakes: bake and decorate beautiful cakes at home]], she was featured in a recent retro-themed issue of the UK magazine Baking Heaven and recently released her second cookbook, \"Deliciously Vintage.\"<br /><br />\"Deliciously Vintage\" rounds up sixty favorite bakes from around the globe, including a wonderful selection of British standards (Jammy Dodgers, rock cakes, fat rascals, Chelsea buns, Bakewell tart, Battenberg cake, puddings) as well as international offerings (Australian Lamingtons, French madeleines, eclairs and clafoutis, South African melktert, Austrian Sachertorte, and many American contributions such as Mississippi mud pie, hummingbird cake, and  Boston cream pie). Each recipe has a charming little story that gives background on a particular recipe; I found the British ones particularly amusing with schoolyard humor (\"squashed fly cakes\" for Eccles cakes, \"dead man\\'s arm\" for the jelly roll).<br /><br />Divided into biscuits and cookies, small cakes and bakes, large cakes, pastries, and desserts, you\\'ll be sure to find the perfect baked good for any occasion, whether a dainty tea party (madeleines, Florentines, cream buns, lemon drizzle cake), elegant European coffee (Opera cake, Sachertorte, Kugelhopf),  to a (children\\'s) birthday party (cute butterfly cakes, PB&J cake, devil\\'s food cake - hot chilis optional, although the chili horns make a particularly devilish touch indeed!). Best of all, ingredients should all be commonly available at your local grocery store.<br /><br />Recipes are given in Imperial and US (volume) measurements; along with ingredients, you will also find a list of all required bakeware at the bottom of the page. I made the Chelsea buns and the Bakewell tart first; the Chelsea buns are much leaner than traditional American cinnamon rolls (also featured in the book), and you can substitute whatever dried fruit you have on hand for the filling. Victoria\\'s instructions are straightforward and easy to follow, with helpful hints throughout (she was also kind enough to write back promptly when I had difficulties with a test recipe).<br /><br />As with other Ryland Peters & Small titles, layout and design deserve a special mention. The book has a delightfully retro feel about it, from the red-and-white trim on the cover and matching endpapers to the old-fashioned china and linens in the photos. Each recipe features a full-color photograph on the facing page, and the background of the page featuring the recipe carries over elements from the staged photo. I love that touch with all their books as it lends a sense of continuity that serves to tie the recipe and its photo together.<br /><br />I loved the wide range of international desserts from the UK, Finland, France, Australia, Austria and the US, and these are simple, down to earth bakes that can be accomplished in a relatively short time. Victoria did a lot of baking with her mother and grandmother as a child, and that love shines through in \"Deliciously Vintage;\" it\\'s sure to delight bakers of all ages and there is enough variety to keep you baking happily for many months to come!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters & Small)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I recently started making my own cheese with the \"[[ASIN:0761177485 One-Hour Cheese: Ricotta, Mozzarella, Ch&egrave;vre, Paneer--Even Burrata. Fresh and Simple Cheeses You Can Make in an Hour or Less!]]\", and was looking to expand my fledgling cheesemaking to cr&egrave;me fraiche and mascarpone...enter \"The Creamery Kitchen.\" My first exposure to \"The Creamery Kitchen\" came in the latest issue of the UK baking magazine \"Baking Heaven Savoury;\" I\\'ve discovered several great British cookbooks through the magazine, including [[ASIN:0297869388 The Pocket Bakery]].<br /><br />Jenny Linford is a freelance food writer, a member of the Guild of Food Writers and author of fifteen books ranging from cookery books to ingredient guides. Her interest in food stems from living as a child in Singapore and Italy. In \"The Creamery Kitchen\" she gives both instructions how to make simple dairy products (butter, buttermilk, sour cream, cr&egrave;me fraiche, yogurt, labneh, cream cheese, cottage cheese, ricotta, mascarpone, feta-style cheese) and showcases simple recipes using those products (storebought works just fine if you\\'re in a pinch). There is a brief introduction to \"Creating your creamery\" and ingredients, although I wish the author gave recommendations on substituting vegetarian rennet tablets for liquid rennet, which is what the recipes here call for (I purchased vegetarian rennet tablets in bulk when I bought One-Hour cheese).<br /><br />Starting with simple yet delicious flavored butters (fennel, caramelized, piquant, fragrant spice, rose, and saffron butters), you\\'ll find a chilled cucumber and mint soup with parmesan crisps that is perfect for a sweltering summer day, elegant beetroot latkes with smoked salmon and cr&egrave;me fraiche, asparagus, pea and labneh salad, not one but two variations of the classic Balkan burek, ricotta and spinach dumplings, cheesecakes, and even spaghetti with gorgonzola, pecan and mascarpone sauce. The recipes are straightforward and come together quickly with impressive results.<br /><br />Most of the recipes are vegetarian with a few meat-based recipes (buttermilk fried chicken, lamb skewers, lamb and asparagus tacos with roasted tomato salsa). I loved the distinctly Middle Eastern flavor in the orange semolina cake and roasted red pepper, pomegranate and sumac raita, lamb skewers with za\\'atar labneh, and dukkah flatbreads with herbed labneh, and saffron and cardamom labneh with mango. There are also some Italian-inspired gems like the spaghetti with gorgonzola, pecan and mascarpone sauce and ricotta and spinach dumplings with cherry tomato sauce. Dairy-based desserts, including sour cream raisin pie, coeur a la cr&egrave;me with strawberries and passion fruit, yogurt gelato, whisky and raspberry cranachan cheesecakes, and fig and honey ricotta cheesecake, make up the majority of the offerings.<br /><br />As with other Ryland Peters & Small titles, each recipe is lavishly photographed and layout is clear yet compact on matte pages. At certain points in the recipe / instructions, a cursive font is used that is a bit smaller than the regular sans serif font. Measurements are given in both metric and American measurements. British cooking terms/ingredients give American equivalents when possible (clingfilm = plastic wrap, courgette = zucchini, single cream = light cream, etc.).<br /><br />I tried the lemon thyme feta loaf and orange syrup semolina cake, which is basically a revani/basbousa. The lemon thyme feta loaf was tremendously fragrant and moist from the olive oil and zucchini. My one recommendation is taste your feta first if using storebought as it can be tremendously salty. The recipe calls for 1 tsp salt as written, but I included both the salt and feta and found it was a bit too salty for my taste; next time I will cut back on or eliminate the salt entirely. I baked it in my [[ASIN:B0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf]] pan, which makes for a festive appearance (see photo). For the semolina cake, the cr&egrave;me fraiche took the place of the yogurt I normally use, and although the recipe yielded less syrup than I am accustomed to using, the finished cake turned out perfectly moist and froze well, making it a perfect teatime or breakfast snack.. I loved the chilled soups and simple and easy fresh veggie salads like the asparagus, pea and labneh salad and the broad bean, feta and dill salad; perfect when it\\'s too hot to feel like heating up the oven.<br /><br />Overall this is a great first book if you\\'re new to making soft cheeses and dairy products at home; the instructions and recipes are simple and straightforward and most use ingredients that you should already have on hand (except for some of the Middle Eastern spices like sumac, za\\'atar, and cardamom and some basic cheesemaking supplies like rennet and cheesecloth). I loved the variety of dairy-based Mediterranean/Balkan/Middle Eastern dishes as this is my favorite cuisine, and I love that the preparation is manageable and the recipe yields are small (most main dishes serve 4-6). This is an excellent counterpart to One-Hour Cheese, which focuses on firm cheeses as opposed to creams and soft cheeses, and I will certainly find myself coming back to the \"Creamery Kitchen\" on a regular basis. If you are interested in learning to make your own cr&egrave;me fraiche, mascarpone, yogurt, cottage cheese, and feta, this is the book for you. And I concur with the reviewer who stated `\"...by the end of the book, I was ready to buy my own cow!\"<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters & Small)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I love food-themed mysteries and have read several series; this was the first I\\'d heard of Aunty Lee. Set in Singapore, Aunty Lee runs a popular restaurant that serves Peranakan food, a blend of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian dishes. As I was not previously familiar with Singaporean culture or cuisine, the author did a good job at providing enough detail that it was easy to follow along. The descriptions of food were mouthwatering, although I would have liked to see one or two recipes included in the back of the book.<br /><br />As a narrator, Aunty Lee is certainly likeable enough, a harmless-seeming elder who brought to mind a Singaporean Jessica Fletcher. Aunty Lee infiltrates a prayer group and does her own digging into a series of events leading to the deaths of a prominent lawyer and her son; their deaths are blamed on her buah keluak, a chicken dish served with nuts that if not prepared properly, can prove fatal.<br /><br />My main issue with \"Aunty Lee\\'s Deadly Specials\" was that I had figured out the main plot twist very early into the novel, and was frustrated with how long it seemed to take Aunty Lee to catch on. However, as I enjoyed the cultural elements and descriptions of Peranakan food, I will be sure to pick up the first book in the series for comparison.<br /><br />Verdict: this is a fun beach read, but not one of the best food-themed mystery series I\\'ve read (I still stand by \"Bruno: Chief of Police\" for its wonderful descriptions of food in France\\'s Perigord region!).',\n",

       "  'title': 'Take your tastebuds on a culinary adventure along the Silk Road',\n",
       "  'text': 'I\\'ve been vegetarian for over ten years, and am always looking for creative, healthy ways to spice up my cooking. I\\'ve taught students from more than 100 countries, including many from Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) who were eager to share their languages and cuisines with me. However, there are very few cookbooks that focus on this region, even less so from a vegetarian context, so this is one cuisine that remained relatively unknown to me.<br /><br />In \"Silk Road Vegetarian,\" Dahlia Abraham-Klein has compiled over 120 vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free recipes that serve as an exploration and a celebration of the foods from the Silk Road, from elegant jeweled polos / palaus, curries and dal, Persian kookoos and soups/stews, Bukharian stuffed veggies to shawarma-spiced potatoes, curried veggies, and a wealth of lighter desserts.<br /><br />Along the way, you\\'ll read about Dahlia\\'s culinary pilgrimage and her family\\'s roots in Persia, Afghanistan, Bukhara, India and Israel. The book begins with an excellent and compact illustrated guide to the spice pantry, tips on basic preparation for tofu, legumes, rice and quinoa (with a handy illustrated guide to the various types of rice available and four pages of descriptions and cooking instructions), an excellent guide to food preservation via freezing (which I have not seen in other cookbooks) that gives a step-by-step overview of various cooking and storing methods that will allow you to make the most of an abundance of seasonal produce (or leftovers from your CSA box).<br /><br />You\\'ll find quick and basic staples like hummus, tahini, harissa, za\\'atar, and chutney, light appetizers including stuffed grape leaves, kookoo (herb frittata), Sephardic leek patties, and an amazing Indian red lentil falafel (especially since I am not normally a fan of either lentils OR falafel!). There are many fresh salads like orange and fennel, minted beet salad, curried spinach salad with apples and grapes, and roasted veggies (I particularly enjoyed the roasted carrots with feta and parsley, which I made with rainbow carrots and sheep\\'s milk feta).<br /><br />Curries and hearty stews tend to dominate the main dishes, including curried lentil burgers, chickpea and lentil curries. I really enjoyed the Afghan squash goulash and Afghan risoto; Afghan cooking is relatively unknown to me. As I am a huge fan of rice dishes (and frequently serve them as a main meal), I really appreciated the wide range of polos (shirin polo, with jewel-like dried orange strips, adas polo with apricots and caramelized onions) and Bukharian pilafs. The quick and easy veggie sides are the perfect way to round out a meal.<br /><br />The chapter on desserts offers many lighter (mostly vegan) options, including several rice puddings, parfaits, quick breads, and fruit-based desserts (I tried the orange blossom date balls and they were a hit). Those who are on a gluten-free diet will also appreciate that all the baked goods are also GF, including buckwheat hamentaschen, cinnamon apple cake, and berry-almond coconut scones.<br /><br />The instructions are clear (and the font thankfully large / dark enough to read easily from a cookbook holder) and the ingredients should be commonly available at your supermarket (despite the many Persian and Central Asian recipes, Dahlia uses commonly available substitutes - cranberries for barberries, for example, although you will find one that calls for limoo Omani - dried limes). Gorgeous full-color photos illustrate about half of the recipes. There are step-by-step photos for some of the techniques, making \"Silk Road Vegetarian\" approachable by any level of cook.<br /><br />\"Silk Road Vegetarian\" has given me many new quick and healthy recipes that can be assembled even on a hectic weeknight, and the exotic spices will transport your taste buds. I loved the section on preserving and freezing fruits and veggies, as all too often I found myself throwing away perfectly good produce. This is a perfect cookbook for one who is new to vegetarian / vegan cooking as the clear instructions (particularly for washing and soaking the various types of rice and the guide to preserving fruits and veggies) and step-by-step photos make it easy to follow along.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of the author)',\n",

       "  'title': 'All-in-one stop for glorious Mediterranean mezze, meals and desserts, with plenty of regional variation',\n",
       "  'text': 'Mediterranean food has long appealed to me for several reasons; as a light eater, I prefer the mezze / tapas tradition of grazing from several small dishes versus a large sit-down meal, the emphasis on fresh seasonal produce with simple, uncomplicated flavors to allow the fruits and veggies to shine through, and the fact that so many wonderful dips, spreads, salads, and main dishes are vegetarian-friendly.<br /><br />DK\\'s \"Mediterranean Cookbook\" provides readers with the tools to master more than 300 authentic recipes from the Greek Islands, Spain, Provence, northern Africa, and the Middle East. Recipes are structured by type of food, rather than country of origin, and feature spreads showcase the iconic foods of key regions such as Provence and Tuscany. In typical DK fashion (I own several of their Eyewitness travel guides for Spain, Italy, and Japan), lush photography assists readers in their journey to prepare meals with confidence. Marie-Pierre Moine provides recipes from France and Turkey, While Elisabeth Luard and Ghillie Basan contribute delicious recipes from the western Mediterranean and the Middle East. (I own several of Ms. Basan\\'s other titles on Middle Eastern and North African cooking, including [[ASIN:1849754322 Vegetarian Tagines & Cous Cous: 65 Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One Pot Cooking]], so was happy to see her name as a contributor here).<br /><br />Beginning appropriately enough with mezze, tapas and antipasti, you\\'ll find a wealth of new and familiar favorites like tapenade, canap&eacute;s a la brousse et aux figues (goat cheese, lavender honey, and figs on a toasted baguette), pasteis de bacalhau, hummus and baba ganoush, stuffed grape leaves, and Moroccan fish cakes.<br /><br />As eggs are one of my favorite foods, I really appreciated the eggs chapter, which features such gems as ouefs mimosa a la nicoise (hard-boiled eggs stuffed with black olive tapenade, aioli, lemon zest and topped with anchovy fillets), beid bi tom, uovo alla sarda (eggs in the style of stuffed sardines), shakshouka, piperade, tortilla de primavera and tortilla de habas from Spain, Turkish cilbir, and the pastry-based dishes avga tiropita and brik with eggs.<br /><br />The seafood chapter deserves a special mention for its wonderful whole fish preparations, tajines, bacalao, kebobs and of course that iconic Spanish dish paella, here with handy step-by-step photos. Spanish fabada, cocideo madrileno, and cassoulet are just the ticket for cold winter days. There are some real showstoppers like pato amb peras (duck with glazed pears) for fancier dinner parties. Pizzas, spanakopita, lahma bi ajeen, and bstilla make wonderful portable snacks or delightful nibbles on the patio or terrace.<br /><br />I tried the hortapitta recipe, and found I could have done with a few more instructions; the spanakopita recipe specified the size of the phyllo sheets, while the hortapitta recipe simply said \"10 oz. package of phyllo dough.\" Also, the spanakopita recipe called for a 9 x 12 pan, while the hortapitta recipe simply said \"brush a baking sheet with a little melted butter and layer in two-thirds of the phyllo sheets.\" I found this a little too vague and wasn\\'t sure about the size of the pan (this is only supposed to serve four), so I had to cut down the phyllo sheets to fit. Another step I found odd between the two recipes was the spanakopita called for preparing the filling first, then assembling, while the hortapitta recipe has you begin to layer the phyllo in the pan then prepare the filling, which takes a good 10-15 minutes, allowing the phyllo to dry out. I decided to assemble mine right before baking instead. I loved the flavor of the filling, but had miscalculated the amount of phyllo (it would be helpful if it listed the phyllo sheet size / number of sheets / suggested baking pan size). Other recipes had clearer instructions; I loved the sigari boregi, panzerotti, and empanadillas de atun.<br /><br />I also loved some of the unique salads and vegetable preparations such as the Sicilian orange salad, patlican salatasi, and mahshi felfel. The tomatoes deserve special mention, especially the tomates a la provencale and tomates confites. As I am primarily a baker, the fatayer bi zahtar, khubz bil hummus, fougasse aux olives, crostini napolitana were wonderful and easy enough to be in frequent rotation.<br /><br />To end your Mediterranean meal or tapas party on a sweet note are a variety of fruit-based desserts, including amaretti-stuffed peaches, Moroccan orange salad, membrillo, and pears poached in Marsala. You\\'ll also find Middle Eastern puddings, flan, cheesecake, a showstopping cassata gelato from Sicily, and an intriguing pine nut - candied fruit tart from Provence. The Galician favorite pastel de Santiago makes an appearance, as do Tuscan chestnut flour cake, Sicilian cannoli, and the gorgeous (and delicious) Moroccan m\\'hanncha and Greek baklava.<br /><br />From the book\\'s attractive \"tiled\" cover featuring typical Mediterranean fruits and veggies to the gorgeous photography of ingredients and feature spreads on spotlight cuisine (Tuscany, Greece, Lebanon, Morocco, Spain, Sicily, Provence, Turkey), you are sure to find many dishes to fall in love with whether this is your first Mediterranean cookbook or you are a seasoned pro. The many helpful photos and sidebars on Mediterranean ingredients and step-by-step photos for some of the more complicated dishes make this a great choice for new cooks, although you may need to refer back to similar recipes for more guidance as previously mentioned.<br /><br />DK\\'s \"Mediterranean Cookbook\" is quickly becoming my go-to for Mediterranean dishes from appetizers to dessert without having to reach for individual cookbooks focusing on specific countries or ingredients; you\\'ll find enough variety to keep you happily experimenting for months to come!<br /><br />(Thank you to DK for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Cooking from the heart Gujarati-style',\n",
       "  'text': 'Prashad is an Indian vegetarian restaurant in West Yorkshire that was named Best Restaurant by no less than Gordon Ramsay. The word \"Prashad\" means \"sacred offering\" and refers to religious food offerings left at temples. Amazon happened to recommend Prashad to me as I was looking at other UK-authored vegetarian cookbooks. I was instantly intrigued, as I am quite familiar with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern vegetarian cuisine, but Indian cuisine is relatively unknown to me other than some Indian restaurant standards like tikka masala and saag paneer. I\\'ve been vegetarian for over ten years and am always on the lookout for new dishes to add to my repertoire, and \"Prashad\" opened my eyes (and my spice cupboard!) to the myriad of flavors and textures in Gujarati cuisine and introduced me to new ways of cooking that will make it into my regular rotation, particularly how to make masalas and tarkas (heating spices in hot oil). Gujarati cuisine is also very vegetarian-friendly as it is strongly influenced by Jain vegetarianism and traditional Hinduism.<br /><br />I reached out to Prashad through Facebook and the restaurant was kind enough to send out an autographed review copy from the UK. The book is written by matriarch Kaushy (her son Bobby is the current owner and manager of the restaurant). Kaushy\\'s four simple rules (fresh and fantastic, prepare, relax, and cook with love) and clear instructions make this flavorful vegetarian cuisine accessible to any level of cook. As many of the cooking utensils and ingredients were new to me, I particularly appreciated the illustrated guide to ingredients and utensils and the several pages of practical points, top tips and how to (roasting seeds, stopping eggplant from oxidizing, stopping dhal from foaming over, preventing tarka spices from burning, balancing spicy foods, etc.) Sharing extra food with friends and neighbors (\"vakti vevar\") is also an important step to creating community bonds in Gujarati culture. The several sample menus in the back will allow you to create an authentic Gujarati feast for family and friends with plenty to share!<br /><br />As this is a UK cookbook, recipes are in metric / temperatures in Celsius, but as I frequently cook using metric, this is no issue as long as you have a good kitchen scale. Many of the starters / appetizers are fried, but Kaushy also provides instructions for baking them for a lower-fat alternative, which I greatly appreciated as I try to avoid fried foods. You will also find variations that will add extra mileage, and serving suggestions on what to pair each recipe with (I liked that the page numbers were provided for quick reference and tabbed those so I could quickly flip back and forth between the two). Beautiful full-color photos on matte paper and colorful illustrations of elephants and geometric prints give a much-needed splash of color and makes the pages \"pop\". At the back of the book is a guide of Kaushy\\'s suggested brands, although most may only be available in the UK or online (the only commercial brand I saw near me was Deep). The clear step-by-step instructions with helpful visual and auditory cues (\"when the mustard seeds begin to pop, turn the heat to low\") make you feel as though Kaushy is standing next to you guiding you;  Kaushy also gives cooking classes at The Cooking School at Dean Clough Mills, which I would love to attend.<br /><br />I also loved the sample menus for special occasion feasts, weekend dinner party, and three sample quick midweek suppers. This section is particularly well-suited for new cooks, as Kaushy gives timing instructions for each step of the dinner so all the dishes are ready at the same time. This is extremely helpful and something which is frequently left out of other cookbooks.<br /><br />The most difficult challenge will undoubtedly be finding the fresh Indian vegetables, pulses, and specialty flour blends locally; even with an Indian and Middle Eastern grocery store at my disposal, I was unable to source some of the more \"exotic\" ingredients like colocasia leaves, hyacinth beans,  and bottle gourd, but found enough staples to make several of the dishes that caught my eye, including the pethis (garlic-coconut filled potato balls), handvo (seed topped lentil cake), paneer tikka (with homemade paneer that I added curry powder to from [[ASIN:0761177485 One-Hour Cheese: Ricotta, Mozzarella, Chèvre, Paneer--Even Burrata. Fresh and Simple Cheeses You Can Make in an Hour or Less!]]), ferar bataka (ginger-chili peanuts and potatoes), and chole. Some of the dishes like chole come together quickly, while others like the handvo require time for prep (the dough must ferment at least 12 hours). There is also a chapter on rice dishes and breads that includes many Gujarati staples such as rotli, bhakri, juvar na rotla, paratha, puri and bathura.<br /><br />I have a notorious sweet tooth and am quite familiar with Middle Eastern desserts like baklava and basbousa and some Indian desserts like gulab jamun, but loved the carrot pudding, dhud pak (cardamom, almond and pistachio rice pudding) and mava lapsi (spiced fruit, nut, and cracked wheat pudding, which reminded me of the Ukrainian kutya) from Prashad. I enjoyed trying out some of the accompanying dishes like imli chutney; tamarind is easy to find in my town both fresh and dried, and I loved the tangy sweet-sour-spicy kick this gave to dishes. I am particularly fond of chutneys and pickles, which had always intimidated me before (I will admit to buying commercial chutney, which always seemed lacking or too sweet). I can\\'t wait to try the murabho (cinnamon and cardamom-infused sweet mango pickle) as mangoes are plentiful in my city; I use piloncillo in place of jaggery as it is much easier to come by in my neck of the woods.<br /><br />Pleasing to the eyes and stomach, Prashad opened up a whole new world of flavors and cooking techniques from Gujarati cuisine; a second Prashad cookbook is currently in the works, and based on the fabulous recipes and cultural tidbits in the first book, it will be on my must-buy list!<br /><br />(Thank you to Kaushy, Bobby, and the Prashad staff for the review copy and I hope to visit you in Drighlington one day!)',\n",

       "  'title': 'A beautiful compilation of Thai cooking and culture',\n",
       "  'text': 'Jean-Pierre Gabriel spent three years traveling through every region of Thailand visiting homes, markets and restaurants, sampling dishes from every corner and collecting recipes along the way. The result is a collection of 500 easy-to-follow recipes and 200 breathtaking images of Thailand\\'s landscape, people, and food. The scope of the book is truly impressive; hundreds of Thai cooks contributed recipes (you\\'ll find the list of contributors in the back) and all regions of Thailand are represented. Most Thai cookbooks marketed to American audiences seem to focus on  well-known dishes like pad Thai that are on American Thai restaurant menus; here you\\'ll find insect-based dishes from Thailand\\'s Northeast (Issan), where ingredients such as bamboo caterpillars, house crickets, and giant water bugs are foraged, pork dishes from Northern Thailand (including many sausage-based dishes), desserts from Central Thailand, seafood from Eastern Thailand, and Indian-influenced / Muslim dishes from Southern Thailand.<br /><br />The book begins with a series of essays that explore the history of Thailand\\'s regions and cuisine and includes chapters on snacks and drinks, salads and soups, curries, stir fries, rice and noodles, grilled and fried dishes, desserts and more. Each recipe includes the dish\\'s name in Thai (no English transliteration), the region, preparation time and cooking time. Measurements are given in  imperial, weight, and metric, with British terms in parentheses where applicable. There are generally two recipes to a page (four to a spread). Throughout the chapters, gorgeous matte photos of Thai landscapes, markets, ingredients and people give a comprehensive view at the diversity and natural abundance of Thailand. Staged photos of raw ingredients are like miniature artworks.<br /><br />Thai cuisine is based on several principles, the most important being the four fundamental taste areas: spicy, sweet, sour, and salty. Two of the fundamental cooking methods, steaming and stir frying in a wok, are inherited from the Chinese. A nonstick wok is bet for stir-frying rice or noodle dishes, while stainless steel or cast-iron woks are more suitable for stir-frying fish, meat or vegetables. I was fascinated to learn of the history of various fried rice dishes; the few times I\\'d seen them on the menu in Thai restaurants, I assumed it was an attempt to cater to Chinese food enthusiasts, but fried rice a long history in Thailand, and you\\'ll find many complex and delicious variations here: seafood fried rice (shrimp paste fried rice with sweet pork, crab fried rice), Thai pork fried rice with fried eggs, fried rice with pineapple, etc. I also loved the noodle dishes like fried noodles in coconut milk with shrimp, which has a tart element from tamarind sauce, sweetness from coconut milk and palm sugar, and heat from chilies.<br /><br />There is an extensive collection of curry dishes, which introduced me to a whole new range of Thai cooking including fish curry in banana leaf (luckily our Central Market always carries fresh banana leaves), roasted duck curry, coconut milk curries, and mango curry. Seafood is also amply represented, with many seafood curries along with grilled, fried, and stir-fried fish and crab dishes.<br /><br />I have an infamous sweet tooth, and the only Thai dessert I was familiar with before \"Thailand: The Cookbook\" was sticky rice and mangoes, but I was fascinated to learn of the candied fruits and vegetables that reminded me of Mexico (pumpkin in syrup, sweet potato in ginger syrup, candied sugar palm fruit), steamed puddings, and bean-based desserts (mung bean porridge with coconut milk, colorful mung bean noodles in coconut milk, mung bean puddings and custards). Not surprisingly, fruit plays a starring role, particularly bananas and coconut.<br /><br />The final chapter is a list of guest chefs from Thai restaurants in Sydney (Sailors Thai, Chat Thai), New York (Kin Shop, Uncle Boons), London (Rosa\\'s Thai Café), and Bangkok (Bo.lan, Kiin Kiin) and their selected recipes.<br /><br />The most challenging aspect will be finding the fresh (and staple) ingredients called for in many of the regional recipes (pandan leaves, sugar palm fruits, durian, tiger grass leaves, pork floss, dried buffalo skin, some seafood, frog, and fresh insects (crickets, ants, ant eggs, giant water bug eggs). There is no list of suggested online (or local) Thai markets, and no substitutions suggested in the ingredients (although you will find suggested substitutions in the glossary for select ingredients). For this reason, I will not be able to make many of the more \"authentic\" recipes, but there are still plenty that I can try with my limited range of Thai ingredients that I can purchase locally (lemongrass, Thai chilies, tamarind, kaffir lime leaves, banana leaves, fish sauce).<br /><br />Overall, \"Thailand: The Cookbook\" is a labor of love and a beautiful travelogue that will introduce you (or take you back to) Thailand\\'s rich cultural and culinary diversity. The staggering number of recipes is sure to feature something for everyone and provides plenty of variety to keep you experimenting happily for many months (if not years) to come. The book itself is gorgeous, starting with the gold-embossed fabric cover and extending through the book\\'s design, including intricate geometric designs that mark each particular chapter in the Table of Contents. Whether you are already familiar with  Thai cuisine or are looking for an approachable introduction, \"Thailand: The Cookbook\" deserves a place on your cookbook shelf.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Phaidon)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'m fairly new to gluten-free (GF) cooking and baking, although I\\'ve checked out several GF cookbooks from the library the last couple of years. I recently entered the world of GF baking with [[ASIN:1615190864 Nosh on This: Gluten-Free Baking from a Jewish-American Kitchen]], which served as an excellent primer for why GF flours and doughs react differently than their gluten-containing counterparts. I also learned how to create my own GF all-purpose mix using the recommended [[ASIN:B000216O16 Authentic Foods Superfine White Rice Flour - 3lb]] and [[ASIN:B00021639Y Authentic Foods Gluten Free Brown Rice Flour Superfine -- 3 lbs]]; I was surprised to see that Authentic Foods was not one of the reviewed/featured flour brands in the America\\'s Test Kitchen book as they have received many excellent reviews from GF bakers. Naturally, I jumped at the chance of reviewing the \"How Can It Be Gluten-Free Cookbook\" as I am a fan of America\\'s Test Kitchen and was looking for ideas for more gluten-free vegetarian dishes ([[ASIN:1557885109 The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen: Delicious and Nutritious Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free Dishes]] is also a great book).<br /><br />The book starts off with brief overviews of the science of gluten, strategies for replacing wheat flour, a handy baking troubleshooting guide, choosing (or making) a GF all-purpose blend, a taste test of commercial GF flour blends, ATK\\'s recipe for their all-purpose blend (unlike \"Nosh on This,\" ATK uses the addition of nonfat milk powder to aid in browning, along with potato and tapioca starch), how to measure GF flours (they recommend weighing rather than volume), the use of binders, substitutions, and the gluten-free pantry, including reviews of commercial GF sandwich bread (seven of the eight received \"recommended with reservations\" or \"not recommended\") and gluten-free pastas; not surprisingly, the corn spaghetti and pasta scored the lowest. I liked their tip that rice noodles should NOT be cooked according to package instructions as they will fall apart; instead, it is recommended to soak them under very hot tap water for 20-45 minutes depending on the type of noodle. And be careful when purchasing soba, as not all soba is 100% buckwheat but may contain a mix of flours (I use [[ASIN:B005P0WMJ2 Eden Foods - Buckwheat Soba Pasta - 8 oz.]]). I also appreciated the in-depth guide (with photos) on the various types of whole grains, including rice as well as buckwheat, oat groats, millet and quinoa. Several methods are given for cooking grains: the pasta method, absorption method, and pilaf method. A chart explains which cooking methods are suited to which grains.<br /><br />Beginning with breakfast, you\\'ll find fluffy GF pancakes, waffles, crepes, quick breads, muffins, and coffee cake. I loved their quick method for steel-cut oats; because of the long cooking time, I never make them on weekdays, but here you boil the water, add the oats and let sit overnight. The next morning, you add additional liquid (milk, water, or juice depending on the variation) and reheat for  5-6 minutes. I tried several of the grain salads, including the wild rice pilaf with pecans and cranberries and the oat berry pilaf with walnuts and gorgonzola. I really enjoyed the blend of flavors and textures, especially the oat berry pilaf. I want to try the quinoa patties with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes at a later date as those also look promising.<br /><br />Huge bonus points for including a chapter on making fresh GF pasta; this is the first GF cookbook I\\'ve seen that actually walks you through the steps, run the dough through your pasta machine and cut/shape your dough. I wasn\\'t as impressed with the small variety of pasta sauces to go with commercial GF pasta (ATK\\'s top pick was Jovial Brand) and would recommend [[ASIN:0936184582 Italian Classics (Best Recipe)]] instead. I loved the Asian-inspired noodle dishes like soba noodles with roasted eggplant and spicy basil noodles with crispy tofu.<br /><br />The breads chapter makes the curious omission of not mentioning that gluten-free bread pans do exist; King Arthur Flour sells one made by USA Pan that is essentially a [[ASIN:B001TO3CN8 USA Pans 9 x 4 x 4 Inch Pullman, Aluminized Steel with Americoat]] minus lid. Gluten-free loaves need more support while baking, so a tall, narrow pan is better suited to this than a traditional loaf pan. Instead, ATK recommends the fussy process of making a foil collar similar to a souffle. I was pleased to see more international influences in the form of Soca (chickpea crepes from Southern France), arepas, pupusas, and pao de queijo.<br /><br />The desserts chapters deserve special mention for their inclusion of elegant tarts (Nutella, Lemon, Rustic Walnut), gratins, pavlovas, and cakes. At the very back is a conversions and equivalencies chart and a weight-to-volume equivalencies for GF flours.<br /><br />Overall, \"How Can It Be Gluten-Free\" sticks to ATK\\'s standard format of lavishly illustrated product reviews, an ample description of why a given recipe works (and the food science behind it), and several variations for most dishes. I did find that there were far fewer bakeware recommendations (like the curious omission of the gluten-free loaf pan, or their take on whether silicone bakeware would work well for GF muffins, etc.). Each baked good comes with a handy chart with substitution instructions for commercial GF blends by Bob\\'s Red Mill GF All-Purpose Blend and King Arthur Gluten-Free Multi-Purpose Flour, which is very handy if that\\'s all you have on hand and time is short. There are plenty of variations (and international influences) to keep you happily experimenting for weeks (or months) to come. This is certainly a book I will find myself using on a regular basis, particularly for the many great meatless options, and a worthy addition to your gluten-free kitchen.',\n",

       "  'text': 'When Faith Gorsky married her husband in the Middle East, she was introduced to a cultural and culinary world that would forever change how she experienced food and cooking. After her wedding, Faith spent six months in the Middle East and had the opportunity to learn traditional Middle Eastern dishes from her Syrian mother-in-law. During these cooking lessons, she faced language barriers and the lack of standardized measurements (\"a small coffee cup of rice\" or \"some milk\"), but eventually mastered several basic recipes and techniques and started cooking for the extended family.<br /><br />Faith started her blog \"An Edible Mosaic\" in 2009 as a place to encourage experimentation in the kitchen and to share the wealth of information she had learned about Middle Eastern cuisine, making what were traditionally orally-transmitted recipes into attainable recipes that American home cooks could attempt. \"An Edible Mosaic,\" like her blog of the same name, is a collection of these homestyle Middle Eastern (particularly Syrian) dishes. One important note is that \"An Edible Mosaic\" (the cookbook) focuses solely on Middle Eastern cuisine, while \"An Edible Mosaic\" the blog includes a range of international influences. If you\\'re looking for some of Faith\\'s other recipes, you won\\'t find them here. Also, many of these recipes are new to the cookbook and have not been previously featured on the blog.<br /><br />Because the book is written from a Syrian perspective, the names of some dishes may be different from the ones you are used to seeing in Middle Eastern cookbooks or restaurants  (shakshouka is listed as \"juzmuz,\" basbousa = \"harissa,\" etc.). A handy list of Middle Eastern grocery stores (and websites) will allow you to stock up on supplies like apricot leather, cardamom pods, dried limes, mastic, and flower waters that may be difficult to find locally.<br /><br />Gorgeous color photos illustrate every page, starting with basic cooking tools and ingredients (the photos of making perfect rice and how to hollow out veggies were particularly helpful), and draw you into the stories behind each recipe. Each chapter features distinctive borders printed with colorful Middle Eastern tiles. I loved the staging of the photos as each photo includes a uniquely Middle Eastern touch, from gold-embroidered runners to dainty fenajeen (demitasse cups).<br /><br />The book is a miracle of compactness, managing to fit nine lavishly illustrated chapters into only 144 pages. A basic section on cooking tips and techniques introduces sidebars on basic cooking tips as well as putting together maza platters and coffee the Middle Eastern way. Basic cooking tools are also explored, including some that are likely less familiar to American audiences (ma\\'amoul molds, della, hafara). There\\'s a buyer\\'s guide to Middle Eastern ingredients and several basic recipes (clotted cream, taratoor, basic savory pie dough, scented sugar syrup, basic spice mixes) before launching into breads and pies, which includes Middle Eastern flatbreads, sesame seed breads, spiced meat flat pies, and spinach turnovers. The salads chapter gave me many quick and tasty new additions to my maza, including chickpea salad with lemony mint salad dressing, colorful cabbage salad with lemony mint salad dressing, beet salad with tahini dressing (I love beets and tahini in all shapes and forms, and had never thought to combine the two before!), and standards like Middle Eastern salad, tabbouleh, and fattoush.<br /><br />Vegetarians will find much to enjoy in the salads chapter and the vegetable and rice side dishes, including the herbed potato salad, fried cauliflower with sesame parley sauce, saffron rice with golden raisins and pine nuts, and the many appetizers (zucchini fritters, juzmuz (shakshouka), herbed omelets, spiced cheese balls, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves. Protein can be found in the form of foul mudammas, hummus, tissiyeh, and falafel. I particularly enjoyed the lentil and bulgur pilaf with caramelized onions.<br /><br />Meat-based classics like kibbeh (including a recipe for raw kibbeh), shwarma, kabsa, and sheesh taouk are also represented, as is seafood. One of my favorite discoveries was the shrimp in aromatic tomato sauce, which was spiced with cumin, coriander, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and paprika, which complemented its suggested accompaniment of saffron rice with golden raisins and pine nuts.<br /><br />I found the desserts chapter a particular delight, as I\\'ve long appreciated the Middle Eastern desserts that my students from the Gulf would bring to go along with Saudi coffee. There\\'s a very helpful illustrated guide to ma\\'amoul (date-filled cookies traditionally shaped with a wooden mold; one of my Iraqi students introduced me to these), and several variations on puddings (the gorgeous layered apricot and milk pudding makes a stunning finale to any meal). I have a basbousa/harissa recipe from Australia that I normally use that calls for copious amounts of melted butter and yogurt, but Faith\\'s version made with milk was every bit as moist (and no doubt healthier). I also followed her direction to put the harissa under the broiler to brown the top; that\\'s the one step I was never able to get right in the past, and it came out looking every bit as gorgeous as the cookbook photo (see photo).<br /><br />As Faith says in the introduction, her goal for \"An Edible Mosaic\" was to introduce home cooks to traditional Middle Eastern recipes that are delicious and attainable as well as to teach a bit of Middle Eastern culture along with the cuisine as the two are so closely intertwined. Even if you already have other Middle Eastern cookbooks, you\\'ll be sure to find new and memorable recipes here (most of my Mediterranean / Middle Eastern cookbooks focus on Lebanon, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, so some of the Syrian dishes were new to me). Overall, \"An Edible Mosaic\" is a great entry into the world of homestyle Middle Eastern cooking that is perfect for any level of home cook!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Tuttle Publishing - thank you!)',\n",

       "  'title': \"A vegetarian taste of Morocco that's sure to delight!\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Ghillie Basan, author of several cookbooks on Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine including [[ASIN:1848859848 Classic Turkish Cooking]] and [[ASIN:1845979486 Tagines & Couscous: Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One-pot Cooking]], offers up a vegetarian (mostly vegan) Moroccan feast in \"Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous.\"  Although at first glance this would appear to be a slim volume (65 recipes total), \"Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous\" is a wonderful all-in-one source for Moroccan pantry staples, light mezze and appetizers, creative ways to make the most of seasonal vegetables and produce, and wonderful couscous and fruit salads that are welcome any time of year. The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out, and most ingredients should be readily available at your local supermarket. Most of the recipes can be easily made vegan by swapping out agave for honey, using olive oil in place of butter, or by omitting the cheese and eggs (there are relatively few recipes that call for either).<br /><br />Beginning with essential recipes such as preserved lemons, smen, harissa, chermoula, and ras el hanout, the book offers a diverse selection of light appetizers including cracked green olives and cardamom and harissa, crudités with red chilli dukkah dip, filo fingers stuffed with feta, olives, and preserved lemon, smoked aubergine and yogurt dip with harissa, and strained yogurt and cucumber dip with rose petals. There are also several flavor-infused soups like creamy pumpkin soup with ginger and chilli honey and chilled almond and garlic soup.<br /><br />The included tagines (both light and hearty) offer a wide range of preparations of vegetables and legumes including the wonderful tagine of artichokes, broad beans, apricots and almonds, onion, olive, and egg tagine with zahtar, and tagine of spicy roasted pumpkin wedges with lime. There are also a number of fruit tagines including the tagine of roasted pear with figs, walnuts and cardamom, stuffed prune tagine with walnuts and rosewater, and pumpkin, apple, and sultana tagine with chermoula, that are a wonderful way to braise fruit to a soft, creamy consistency. I enjoyed the stuffed prune tagine with its spiced wine reduction over Greek yogurt in the mornings!<br /><br />The cooking instructions for the several couscous dishes yield a light, fluffy couscous unlike the \"typical\" American boxed couscous. True Moroccan couscous is made fresh and is slowly steamed and fluffed until light and airy. The couscous recipes here are a compromise between the two methods, yielding light, fluffy couscous without the long time steaming, fluffing, adding liquid and repeating. Ghillie has you first soak the couscous in warm water, then fluff the grains with a fork to separate, rub oil into the grains using your fingers, then aerate before baking to heat through. I attempted the couscous with dried fruit and nuts and it turned out every bit as beautiful (and delicious) as the cover photo! You\\'ll also find the traditional couscous with seven vegetables as well as a saffron couscous with roasted coconut and pistachios, couscous with hot apricot chutney and halloumi (the recipe for the homemade chutney is worth the cost of the book alone!), and harissa couscous with pine nuts and fried eggs.<br /><br />One important word of caution is that your type of tagine and stovetop may result in many of these being prepared in a dish other than a tagine as many of the tagines are cooked on the stovetop versus oven; I have a ceramic stovetop and two clay tagines and was advised not to use clay/terra cotta tagines even with a heat diffuser, so for the many stovetop preparations I used my 4.5-quart Staub Dutch oven instead. If you have a Staub or Le Creuset cast iron tagine, then you should be fine using them directly on a ceramic stovetop.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts (and a wonderful way to close out a meal) is the gorgeous fruit salads; I made the orange and date salad with chillies and preserved lemon and grapefruit and pomegranate salad with rosewater (see photo); these quickly became favorites and I make them at least every other week now. They are easy to put together and the flavors work wonderfully together, not to mention the striking presentation (I like to fan out the orange segments into a star shape). The contrast between sweet and tart (the preserved lemons), or fruity and floral, serves to balance out spicier dishes or as an anytime treat. Several basic jams and pickle recipes are also included (tomato jam with cinnamon and roasted sesame seeds, lemon, coriander and mint jam, pickled pears with saffron and cinnamon, date relish, and pickled red chillies and purple turnips).<br /><br />The book\\'s graphic layout and photography by Steve Painter is also stunning, featuring vibrant piles of spices, silks, and gorgeous tilework interspersed throughout. There are full-page, full-color photos for nearly every finished dish.<br /><br />I find myself turning to \"Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous\" frequently for the many creative, delicious takes on traditional Moroccan stews; there is plenty of variety to keep you experimenting happily for many weeks or months to come!<br /><br />(review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters & Small)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Has finally been demystified in the lighthearted (and uber-delicious) \"The Book of Buns\" by Jane Mason, the author of [[ASIN:1849752575 All You Knead Is Bread: Over 50 Recipes from Around the World to Bake & Share]]. Hint: it\\'s not the gym. From page 9: \"If you want firm buns, go to the gym. The joy of buns is the fluffy, soft squishiness of them.\"  And the book\\'s dedication: \"To Enrique who loves my buns.\"<br /><br />Containing over 50 recipes for various types of sweet and savory buns from (virtually) every corner of the globe, you\\'ll be sure to make several tasty new discoveries that will make their way into your regular baking rotation. Not surprisingly, many of the recipes are European; hot cross buns, saffron buns, Chelsea buns and Lincolnshire plum buns from the UK, numerous sweet buns from Switzerland, Norway, Hungary, and Armenia, pirozhki and bublik from Eastern Europe, and plenty of crusty German rolls to round things out.  Latin America is also well represented, with recipes from Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and El Salvador. The Middle East/ Africa offers numerous buns such as ka\\'ak (Syria),  khubza bil ashab (Libya), khubz mahala and bun muska (Iran), khubz mbassis (Tunisia), meloui (Morocco), and shubbak el-habayeb (Iraq). You\\'ll also find Montreal-style bagels and monkey  bread from North America. There is truly something for everyone represented here!<br /><br />Ingredients (both metric and volume) and instructions are very clearly laid out, and a helpful guide to ingredients, working with dough, and basic shaping and filling techniques will get you started on the right foot. Each recipe is illustrated with a photo of the finished bun, and many feature numbered step-by-step photos as well, which are tremendously helpful for the more involved recipes. All of these recipes freeze well and can be reheated quickly in the microwave or oven.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the Lebanese sfoof, a beautiful yellow bun twisted into elegant rings and sprinkled with chopped pistachios. The addition of mahlab, anise seeds, and orange blossom water give these a delicate spice; due to the 30 minutes of hand kneading, they are moist and fluffy and go excellently with Turkish coffee.<br /><br />The second recipe I tried was the bastounakia (literally \"salt sticks,\") a sourdough-ish Greek breadstick made with plenty of chopped fresh rosemary. I also brushed mine with [[ASIN:B004HIZ7HW Amoretti Premium Organic Extra Virgin finishing Olive Oil Infused with the Natural Flavor & Aroma of Kalamata Olives - 500ml Bottle]] and Cornish sea salt that took these over the top. These would pair well with any salad or soup.<br /><br />The third recipe I tried as the dolce Milanese, a sweet layered bun filled with a pound of raisins (I threw together the remnants of my dried fruit, so mine was a mix of currants, golden raisins, and regular raisins). I should have done a better job draining the raisins (including patting them off with paper towels), because I found the dough unpleasantly wet to work with during the several rounds of folding in the fruit. However, the final bread was moist and flaky (if a little heavy from all the fruit!) and froze well.<br /><br />I also made several of the Asian-inspired recipes including the coconut buns from China (you will also find several variations on Chinese steamed dumplings) and Japanese anpan. Having lived in Japan, I am addicted to anpan and other sweet buns (red beans, green tea, and red bean paste are frequent ingredients in Japanese pastry), and enjoyed making my own at home. I have bookmarked numerous other recipes to try, including the amazing Bulgarian layered cheese bread tootmanik s gotovo testo, masala buns from India, Moroccan krachel, and South African chocolate sticks.<br /><br />Some general observations: I baked all my buns on a Silpat, and I turned down the heat quite a bit from what was recommended (I tend to bake most of my breads at 350, and perhaps a few minutes at 375 to brown; many of the buns here call for temps as high as 400-425). Also, the author tends to use a lot of salt; I am sensitive to salt, so I cut the recommended amount in half. The bastounakia calls for 2 - 2.5 tsp. for only 16 breadsticks, for example. There is no salt in the dough for this particular recipe, so I went with a light hand when sprinkling the breadsticks. You can also use sourdough in place of yeast; the author gives detailed recommendations for substituting rye- and wheat-based starters for the yeast.<br /><br />One great bonus is the fact that you will develop the arms of a stevedore after hand-kneading all these doughs; I\\'m a firm believer in hand-kneading over a stand mixer as it gives you a much better \"feel\" for when the dough is ready. It is also a great workout for your arms!<br /><br />Overall, \"The Book of Buns\" is a great way to try out sweet and savory bread recipes from around the world in a portable (and freezable!) format. There is plenty of variety to keep you baking happily for many weeks / months to come; if you try one bun recipe a week, you can pretty much get a year\\'s worth of bakes! The clear lists of ingredients, instructions, and directions (and the helpful step-by-step photos) make this approachable by any level of baker, and there are very little specialty flours / ingredients required (with the exception of mahlab and orange blossom water), so you should be able to locate ingredients at your local supermarket. I strongly suggest purchasing a Silpat if you do not already own own; it has revolutionized my bread baking and makes cleanup a snap, plus it is reusable for hundreds of uses.<br /><br />Good luck and happy baking!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters and Small)',\n",

       "  'text': \"Jamie Geller, the &#34;Jewish Rachael Ray&#34; and founder of the Kosher Media Network, is the author of several successful cookbooks, magazines, a popular website, and a TV show. In the beginning, though, she was raised on takeout and it wasn't until her mid-twenties that she gravitated to Jewish observance. The &#34;Bride Who Knew Nothing&#34; was at first clueless about cooking; joining her husband's family meant celebrating more than 100 traditional holiday meals annually for the immediate and extended family. Thankfully, Jamie's experiences learning to cook kosher have benefitted the rest of us with the newest Joy of Kosher cookbook; you'll find dependable, delicious recipes that can be dressed up or down for the occasion, many using pantry staples that you already have on hand.<br /><br />As soon as I got my copy, I put a sticky flag on any recipe that looked interesting; my book soon looked like a colorful porcupine! I ended up trying Uputzi's Vegetarian Chopped &#34;Liver&#34; Pât&eacute;, Butternut Squash Mac `n' Cheese, Blue Cheese, Pear, and Arugula Pizza, Country Spinach, Tomato and White Bean Soup, Hearty Mushrooms with Herbs and Wine (phyllo cup variation), Cold Soba Noodles with Sweet Sesame Tofu, Gooey Chocolate Cherry Cake, Cran-Rosemary Challah and Sun-Dried Tomato, Garlic, and Herb Braided Challah.<br /><br />The book opens with a compact equipment and ingredients list and a brief overview of &#34;the kosher thing&#34; (no pork or shellfish, no mixing meat and milk in the same meal, and processed foods require rabbinic certification). Recipes are clearly labeled with kosher status (meat, dairy, or pareve), prep time, cook time, and number of servings. I also loved that every recipe comes with ideas on how to dress it up, dress it down, make a meal, and variations that allow you to get several results from a single dish. Each recipe also has a suggested kosher wine pairing as well. Instructions are simple and ingredients should be readily available at your local supermarket; this would make a great housewarming or wedding gift as it is approachable by any level of cook.<br /><br />I loved all of the recipes I tried and found they worked exactly as written; for the bread recipes, I used Voil&agrave;! Hallah Traditional Egg Bread Mix and combined them with the various toppings / fillings from the challah chapter. My absolute favorite find was the Vegetarian Chopped Liver - I've tried other vegetarian chopped &#34;liver&#34; recipes in the past that were bland and forgettable, but this one is AMAZING. A puree of toasted walnuts, mushrooms (I used cremini), garlic, onion, thyme and chopped hard-boiled eggs, it is meaty and satisfying and is wonderful on bread, crackers, or as a sandwich spread.<br /><br />I loved experimenting with the &#34;dress it up, dress it down&#34; variations (I tried the butternut squash mac and cheese both ways; I split the batch and made half in an 8x8 pan and the rest as the suggested muffin cups, which made perfect individual servings that I then froze for a quick and easy snack or light meal). There are nods to Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Israeli cuisine, Asian (I loved the cold soba noodles with sweet sesame tofu), Mexican (blackened tilapia tacos, skirt steak with salsa verde), Middle Eastern, kid-friendly recipes...in short, something for everyone (even vegetarians like myself will find plenty of quick, tasty recipes to try). The dessert chapters deserve special mention as well, with many impressive cakes and cookies (I loved the cardamom-scented Chanukah cookies, candied-orange cheesecake, gooey chocolate cherry cake, and the olive oil dark chocolate mousse shots).<br /><br />There are suggested holiday menus at the back with a very thorough guide of how to adapt the given recipes for Passover, a (brief) food glossary, and a more comprehensive Hebrew/Yiddish/Yinglish glossary.<br /><br />Jamie herself sums it up best: &#34;Food is an expression of love. And it doesn't matter if you've never eaten kosher, always eat kosher, or go &#34;kosher casual.&#34; What's important is that food brings us together, and we all want to share our best, most delectable meals with the people we love. And when it's kosher, we're also pulling in thousands of years of love and tradition.&#34;<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of William Morrow / Joy of Kosher)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I own numerous Cook\\'s Illustrated cookbooks and have subscribed to their print and online magazine over the years; their articles on kitchen tips, techniques and troubleshooting have been a lifesaver on more than one occasion.  However, there is also a downside; sometimes you simply want a straightforward recipe without having to read several paragraphs (or pages) of exposition about the various test recipes that were flops before arriving at a successful outcome. But most times, the detailed tips, helpful product ratings / reviews and suggested brands of pantry staples more than make up for an overly \"scholarly\" tone.<br /><br />I consider myself an experienced home baker. I own upwards of 50 baking books alone, along with an arsenal of professional bakeware that I use regularly, so I was very happy to review The Cook\\'s Illustrated Baking Book. It takes a noble stab at introducing the reader to most major categories of baking, including quick breads, yeast breads, cookies, brownies / bar cookies, cakes (chiffon, angel food, pound, Bundt, fruit, layer), fruit desserts, pies and tarts, quiches, pastry, and baked custards, puddings and souffl&eacute;s.<br /><br />Beginning with the basics, you\\'ll find a great illustrated guide to baking ingredients, including how to measure and store sugar, butter temperatures (including what butter should \"look like\" at the various temperature points of chilled, softened, and melted and cooled), and chocolate. There\\'s a good breakdown of the advantages / disadvantages of the  major types of bakeware (tempered glass, dark finishes, insulated, cast iron, silicone), and ten tips for better baking.<br /><br />On to the recipes themselves: as with many Cook\\'s Illustrated cookbooks, you will have one master recipe followed by several variations on a theme (these variations are listed on the main page of the recipe, not as separate listings as in some cookbooks). You\\'ll also find recipes for quick and easy accompaniments like spreads. I tried the chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies with pecans and dried cherries; the cookies seemed almost a touch too sweet (1.5 cups of dark brown sugar), so next time I may scale back slightly, but the flavor combo of chopped tart cherries, bittersweet chocolate chunks and toasted pecans was great, as was the texture. I also appreciated the cookie troubleshooting tips, as cookies are the one item I don\\'t bake frequently. In addition to chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter, you\\'ll find many favorites such as rugelach and biscotti. Similarly, pie dough is given an entire page of illustrations to demonstrate the right way to roll out the crust, fitting the dough, and finishing a single and double-crust pie. There are also some showstopping cakes featured, like the chocolate espresso dacquoise and the apple galette, that will give more experienced bakers a challenge.<br /><br />At the very back is a shopping guide of equipment and ingredients (with photos) that will make it easy to source recommended brands (yes, I really do recommend the [[ASIN:B0015VTR20 Frieling Handle-It Glass Bottom Springform, 9-Inch]]; despite the steep price, it is a great pan that turns out beautiful cheesecakes). I like that they include several different price points for higher-end items; a new baker/chef might do well with an inexpensive Dutch oven, but if you plan on using one regularly, then it\\'s worth splurging for a higher-end one like Staub or Le Creuset).<br /><br />Granted, no one baking book can cover everything, and certain sections towards the end (like the croissants / laminated dough) felt more like an afterthought (croissants could easily take up several chapters alone!), but overall the Cook\\'s Illustrated Baking Book does a good job at covering major categories at a decent price. A few downsides: ALL the photos are black and white, there is no section devoted to holiday baking, and many of the master recipes (and variations) can be found in pretty much any other baking book, but the illustrations, photos and hints make this particularly helpful for those new to baking.',\n",

       "  'title': 'A beautiful (and delicious!) homage to the varied desserts of southern Italy',\n",
       "  'text': 'I happened to discover Rosetta Costantino\\'s \"Southern Italian Desserts\" while researching a trip to Southern Italy. Rosetta, a cooking instructor and author of [[ASIN:0393065162 My Calabria: Rustic Family Cooking from Italy\\'s Undiscovered South]], has collected 75 desserts from Calabria, Campania, Basilicata, Puglia, and Sicily. Sure, you\\'ll find cannoli and gelato here, but there are many other regional gems to discover in each chapter; desserts can vary not only from region to region but from town to town.<br /><br />Sicily offers so much more than cannoli; the divine biscotti Eureka (almond-and-blood-orange-marmalade-filled spirals), chocolate-hazelnut cake rolls, a gorgeous ricotta and pistachio mousse cake named for the 1958 novel Il Gattopardo, a baked ricotta tart, and several gelatos and puddings are all on display, including the elaborate watermelon pudding-filled tart on the book\\'s cover. The illustrated primer on making the perfect cannoli (including shells) was very helpful as well; I\\'ve only worked with store-bought cannoli shells before, so having a detailed how-to was a lifesaver.<br /><br />Campania\\'s offerings are rich with cherries, pears, and some lovely semolina-enhanced cakes and pastries. One of the more unusual offerings here is the eggplant layered with sweetened ricotta and chocolate sauce. Calabria contributes luscious odes to figs and clever peach-shaped cakes filled with ricotta cream. I fell hard for the chocolate-dipped dried figs filled  with almonds and candied orange peel; one of my favorite treats around the holidays are chocolate-dipped figs from Spain, so I loved having the option to make them myself at home. I also fell for the ricotta-filled baked pears; a filling of crushed amaretti, almond paste, and candied orange peel fill ripe pears poached in wine. The elegant ricotta and pear cake was light and refreshing.<br /><br />Other recipes that have become favorites are the biscotti di ceglie (almond cookies with cherry preserves from Puglia). The flavor combination of toasted almonds, a touch of limoncello, honey and cherry preserves is addictive and fun to make; where else can you continually moisten your hands with limoncello instead of plain water? The barchiglia (chocolate-glazed almond tart with pear preserves) was another great find; the combination of pastry crust, pear marmalade, almond pastry cream, and chocolate is layered with flavor.<br /><br />A final chapter of master recipes provides a handy do-it-yourself guide to ricotta cream, nut pastes, fig and grape syrups, and candied orange peel and orange (or blood orange) marmalade, which is a much-appreciated touch as many of these are not available in regular supermarkets.<br /><br />The cookbook itself is beautiful, printed on high-quality matte paper (my preference, as there is less of an issue with glare when placed in a cookbook holder). Ingredients are listed in volume and metric, and a conversion chart is at the back. The font is easy to read and stands out on the page.<br /><br />Along the way, colorful notes on local ingredients, traditions and legends (including how a local pear variety takes its name from a story involving a statue of St. Anthony) share space with beautiful candid photos of cafes, churches, piazzas, Greek temple columns and inviting alleyways. Many of the recipes have full-page color photos, and the step-by-step photos for more complex recipes like the sfogliatelle ricce was extremely helpful in visualizing the technique described in the recipe. A list of sources, a bibliography, and conversion charts round out the book.<br /><br />\"Southern Italian Desserts\" is a beautiful (and delicious!) homage to the varied desserts of southern Italy that make the most of seasonal fruits and local ingredients, along with ample holiday sweets and traditions. The many master recipes for items that would otherwise be expensive or hard to find means that anyone is able to recreate authentic Italian desserts at home; whether you\\'re looking for a simple three-ingredient walnut cookie or an elegant layered tart, you\\'re sure to find something that tickles your sweet tooth in \"Southern Italian Desserts!\"<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Rosetta Costantino and publicist - grazie!)',\n",

       "  'text': \"I purchased my first slow cooker recently, and use it several times a week to make soups, breads, beans and whole grains. When I first started looking for slow cooker cookbooks, I checked out [[ASIN:1933615699 Slow Cooker Revolution]] from the library and was disappointed by the large number of recipes that called for lengthy prep both pre- and post-slow cooking, relied on canned/processed shortcuts, and microwaving ingredients.<br /><br />Enter the Slow Cooker Revolution Volume 2: All 200 recipes have 15 minutes or less of prep, making it easy to get your meal started quickly. Yes, there are still some recipes that call for microwaving veggies (and raw pasta!) prior to slow cooking, and you could also choose to do it on the stovetop if you have a slow cooker with a nonstick insert. However, most of the ingredient lists are much more manageable. Yes, there are still some recipes like the macaroni and cheese with broccoli and parmesan or the chicken pizzaiola that use condensed soup or jarred pasta sauce, but many more recipes appealed to me, like the cherry-sage or apricot ginger glazed chicken, vegetarian entrees, and especially the meals for two. I'm usually only cooking for one and end up with far too many leftovers, so it's nice to have options for smaller yields without having to do the math (I tried the poached salmon and it was so easy!). I also liked the fact that the slow cooker size is referenced; in the dips chapter, for those of us with larger slow cookers (5-7 quarts), you're instructed to bake your dip in a souffle dish; I use my [[ASIN:B0006TJ7FO Pillivuyt Porcelain 6-Cup, 6-1/2-Inch Deep Classic Pleated Souffle Dish]] on top of a [[ASIN:B007QHYPFG Spice Ratchet Blossom Multi-Use Purple Flower Trivet]].<br /><br />There's also a wide range of international influences, from Mediterranean whole grain salads and Provencal chicken to Tex-Mex, Asian, and Italian favorites, that will keep me cooking happily for many months to come. Like other America's Test Kitchen books, you'll find recommendations for various brands and equipment or helpful tips for each recipe. I've already made several recipes including the garlicky shrimp, poached salmon, and warm lentil salad, and would definitely make all three again.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I have loved and used my original edition of \"Artisan Bread in Five\" and gifted several friends with copies - it truly changed my baking habits and has allowed me to put away my bread machine and make homemade bread and rolls (even pastries) at least once a week. Predictably, I was overjoyed when I was offered the chance to review the New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes A Day, featuring many more photos, new recipes (including a whole chapter on gluten-free dough), and updated information.<br /><br />You\\'ll now find revised proofing times, updated equipment guides (I recently purchased a [[ASIN:B00DQCC282 Emile Henry Red Bread Cloche]] so I was pleased to see new instructions for proofing and baking in clay bakers or a covered cast-iron pot). Like any baking book worth its salt, recipes are given in (volume, weight, and metric measurements. New (and appreciated) additions include Crock Pot Bread, Wurzelbrot (Swiss Twisted Bread), Wisconsin beer cheese bread, and some much-needed gluten-free loaves such as sweet brioche and fruit-and-nut spiral rolls. The new step-by-step photos for many of the loaves are a huge help in properly shaping and assembling the more intricate loaves. For those looking for a caloric splurge, the book does sinful things with enriched doughs (the caramel pecan rolls are the best I\\'ve ever tried / made; I usually use the no-knead brioche dough as the base and double the topping / filling to make two pans; the chocolate raisin babka has 16 egg yolks). And like its predecessor, you\\'ll find dishes that pair well with various breads, including a Portuguese fish stew, Tuscan white bean dip, kebabs, and a chilled Moroccan-style gazpacho.<br /><br />If you\\'re new to breadmaking, I would definitely recommend upgrading to the New Artisan Bread in Five, but if you\\'ve been a longtime baker from the first edition and are already comfortable with the basic doughs and instructions, you may want to look at one of their other books like [[ASIN:0312649940 Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day]].',\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'ve  long used Joan Nathan\\'s Holiday [[ASIN:0805211179 The Jewish Holiday Baker]] and Marcy Goldman\\'s [[ASIN:1770500030 A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking]] as my standbys in years past, and was very excited to see the upcoming Holiday Kosher Baker. My Polish grandmother was an excellent baker, and made many wonderful yeast breads and pastries, including cheese babkas, that I\\'ve been seeking to recapture.<br /><br />Beginning with the gorgeous cover photo with its embossed silver pomegranate edges, this is a beautiful cookbook that has pulled out all the stops. The six main sections, which represent the major Jewish holidays chronologically (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Chanukah, Purim, Passover and Shavuot), are color-coded, making it easy to quickly flip to a particular section. Beginning with a handy kosher baking encyclopedia that covers basic baking equipment and tips for cookies, cakes, tarts, mousses and pastries, you\\'ll also find friendly advice on plating desserts, timing and planning holidays, and baking for Jewish lifecycle events.<br /><br />I instantly fell in love with several of the High Holiday desserts, including the elegant apple and honey challah rolls, whole-wheat chocolate babka, and the babka bites. I found the dough for the whole wheat chocolate babka easy to work with; you use a combination of white whole wheat and all-purpose flour. The babka bites are great for impromptu guests or events; the recipe makes about 48 and they freeze well. Also, because these are individually portioned in mini-muffin cups, they\\'re also less messy than handing out slices of babka. Other recipes I tried and will definitely make part of my regular rotation are the almond and olive oil cake (parve), pignons (parve), and the cheese babka (dairy, obviously) that reminded me of my grandmother\\'s babkas and cheese coffeecakes.<br /><br />The Passover section represents the bulk of the holiday recipes, with over 45 Passover recipes representing everything from cookies (biscotti, macarons, meringues) to candies, cupcakes and cakes (layer cake, strawberry Monaco, flourless chocolate amaretti cake), and tarts (the chocolate and pistachio tart and lemon tart with basil nut crust are my new favorites any time of  year!). Non-gebrokts recipes are clearly labeled, and a sidebar on common baking ingredients not available for Passover also help to simplify planning.<br /><br />In addition to favorites like babka, rugelach, (apple) latkes, and hamantaschen, you\\'ll find a strong French influence throughout (Paula graduated from the Ritz Escoffier pastry school in Paris). Among the French-influenced offerings are brioche challah (dairy), tart tatin, madeleines, chestnut mousse, kouigh amann, pear and almond pithivier cake,  cannelés, éclairs, and a variety of macarons (lime, mocha, chocolate mousse).With the exception of the Shavuot recipes, the vast majority are parve (many rely on margarine; I\\'ve had good luck with Earth Balance Buttery Baking Sticks). I also loved the fact that the book addresses special diets: in addition to being kosher, there are vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and low-sugar recipes, truly something for everyone in your family and community.<br /><br />Recipes are given in volume and metric measurements. Along the way, you\\'ll find helpful sidebars that explain techniques and tips for success. With the exception of some of the French recipes (and the several that call for passion fruit), most of the recipes call for commonplace equipment and ingredients that should be readily available in your area. At least one calls for [[ASIN:B008EA1SGI Voilà! Hallah Traditional Egg Bread Mix]], now available at Walmart. Recipes are also labeled by their level of difficulty (easy, moderate, or multiple step), and there are several that would be perfect for pint-sized helpers. Several of the more difficult recipes come with helpful step-by-step photos, and nearly every recipe features a color photo of the final baked good.<br /><br />\"The Holiday Kosher Baker\" is a gorgeous cookbook that I will find myself using year-round; Paula is a fantastic ambassador for expanding kosher (particularly Passover) desserts to include mousse, fresh fruit, and French-inspired dairy-free desserts that prove that \"Passover desserts can be both flavorful and visually stunning.\"<br /><br />(Review copy generously provided by Paula Shoyer and publicist)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I haven\\'t had the pleasure of visiting the Model Bakery (I briefly visited California for the first time last year), but I learned about their eponymous cookbook on Rick Rodgers\\' Facebook page (Rick is one of the book\\'s authors; his amazing [[ASIN:0609604538 Kaffeehaus: Exquisite Desserts from the Classic Caf&eacute;s of Vienna, Budapest, and Prague]] is one of my favorite pastry books out of the dozens I own). I was instantly drawn in by the many classic recipes for breads, yeasted sweets (croissants, pain au chocolat, bear claws, cinnamon rolls), cakes, cookies, pies and tarts. These are simple, traditional, dependable recipes (no fancy flavorings, rare ingredients, or unusual baking equipment required!) that will be sure to delight.<br /><br />With a straightforward table of contents that conveniently fits on one page, it\\'s easy to quickly locate recipes. Each chapter ends with a helpful \"how-to\" section that addresses certain aspects of food science (fermentation, enzymes, wet vs. dry doughs) and practical tips and tricks that will be especially helpful to new bakers (baking one sheet of cookies at a time for best results, parchment paper instead of silicone mats for crisper cookies). A compact look at ingredients (Karen and Sarah recommend Guittard French Vanilla as their chocolate of choice, whole-fat dairy instead of reduced fat, and European-style butter with a high butterfat content) and basic equipment will start bakers off on the right foot. For instance, they point out that \"the thin and shiny cookie sheets that many home bakers have encourage burned cookie bottoms.\" Instead, they recommend using half- and quarter-sheet pans. As a serious home baker with an arsenal of professional pans, I strongly recommend the [[ASIN:B008FK6GQY USA Pan 6-Piece Bakeware Set]] from USA Pans; the pans bake evenly and include a nonstick silicone coating that allows your baked goods to slide right off. Ingredients are given in volume and metric.<br /><br />I have worked with many yeast doughs for pastry over the years, but am fairly new to yeast breads. Even though I have a stand mixer, I prefer to work my doughs by hand, so I appreciate that every bread recipe also includes instructions on how to mix and knead by hand. I recently purchased an [[ASIN:B00C18NGT6 Emile Henry Flame Bread Baking Set - Black]], and am looking forward to trying out some of the Model Bakery\\'s artisan breads like the country olive pain au levain with rosemary. Their baking method involves heating an inverted ovenproof pot to 500; I think I\\'ll take my chances with the cloche! I also loved the wild yeast grape starter; it is unlike any other starter I\\'ve seen in my many baking books. It\\'s a bit harder to track down organic wine grapes in my neck of the woods, but it is worth the effort to do so.<br /><br />The sections on yeasted sweets, breakfast favorites, cakes and cookies were familiar territory for me; I own close to 40 baking books alone, so I am always excited to find new versions of classics. I LOVED the soda bread; moist and fruity (I added the optional currants and caraway seeds), this was addictive and so easy to make. Their take on bear claws was also a bit different than other versions I\\'ve made (this one  has coconut and cake crumbs in the filling in addition to the almond paste). I was also thrilled to see schnecken dough featured.<br /><br />From the cake section, I tried the lemon pound cake (baked in my [[ASIN:B0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf]] pans for a pretty presentation) and the pumpkin gingerbread cake (baked in [[ASIN:B001710JY8 Nordic Ware Platinum Collection Pumpkin Patch Pan]]). I also had to try making the chocolate rads after hearing so much about them; the first batch I made as large as directed (and they are HUGE, easily a good six or seven inches across, see photo), then made the rest of the dough in \"normal\" sized cookies for easier storage and freezing. There\\'s a pound of melted chocolate in the dough and 2 cups of chocolate chips for only 12 cookies, so any diehard chocoholics in your life may have finally met their match! I found that even after chilling the dough for longer than recommended, it was still messy to work with as far as slicing; I might try placing it in the freezer next time to firm it up a bit more.<br /><br />The lack of diagrams and step-by-step photos (particularly for laminated doughs) may make this a little challenging for novice home bakers, but the many tips and hints offer practical insights that I haven\\'t seen in my many other baking books. I loved some of the old-fashioned touches like the berries and cream cake (you have the option of using white or buttermilk cake), coconut cake, and their unique take on lemon squares: instead of making a separate lemon curd, you make a filling that is poured directly into the prebaked crust and baked until set, making it much quicker than other recipes I\\'ve tried. I also discovered some new European favorites like the gateau Basque, a double-crust almond tart filled with cherries and pastry cream.<br /><br />Verdict: \"The Model Bakery\" is a wonderful reference for classic artisan breads, yeasted sweets and cookies, brownies and cakes (including a homemade two-tiered wedding cake for the truly ambitious) that is accessible by bakers of all skill levels. The many stories add a personal feel, and this is comfort baking at its finest.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of the Model Bakery - thank you Karen and Sarah!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'My grandmother\\'s family immigrated from Poland in 1913, and though my grandmother was raised in the United States, she preserved certain Polish traditions at home. I grew up with homemade Polish dishes such as pierogi, golabki, barszcz bialy, and a variety of yeast breads and pastries with farmer\\'s cheese, poppyseeds, and fruit. Unfortunately, babcia did not write down many of her Polish recipes.  Last year, I was looking for authentic Polish cookbooks that would capture some of her homestyle Polish cooking and stumbled upon the beautiful [[ASIN:0956699200 Rose Petal Jam: Recipes and Stories from a Summer in Poland]], so I was very excited to see that \"Sugared Orange\" was coming out.<br /><br />\"Sugared Orange: Recipes and Stories from a Winter in Poland,\" is the second in a series of four books chronicling the rhythm (and flavors) of the seasons in Poland. The first volume, \"Rose Petal Jam,\"  traced Beata Zatorska\\'s  childhood memories and flavors of a Polish summer across different cities including Warsaw, Poznan, Torun,  and Zamosc (a town near my family\\'s ancestral city) via her grandmother\\'s recipes.<br /><br />In \"Sugared Orange,\" we are taken on a journey to Lublin, Warsaw, Krakow, and Lodz, treated to the many scenes of a Polish winter, and invited to participate in winter holidays like St. Nicholas\\' Day, Christmas Eve (Wigilia), and New Year\\'s. For a young Beata, hard-to-get oranges represented Christmas as well as a taste of the exotic; Beata\\'s grandmother used to make sugared orange peel every winter and \"the perfume of orange peel infused my brain with dreams of tropical lands, orange trees, and exotic adventures for when I grew up.\" Beautiful reproduction advertising centering around oranges (and the color orange) is sprinkled throughout. Many orange-infused recipes are featured prominently, including a light, delicate sugared orange cake, a Polish cheesecake studded with sugared orange peel and raisins, orange ice cream, orange shortbread tart and poppyseed pancakes with orange. As candied orange peel can be difficult to locate in the United States, a basic sugared orange peel recipe makes a convenient starting point for many of the later recipes in the book.<br /><br /> \"Sugared Orange\" features many familiar dishes that my babcia used to make, including Christmas Eve sauerkraut with split peas, grated beets with horseradish, stuffed cabbage, and sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi. I also discovered some new favorites such as piernik (gingerbread cake), a loaf rich with spices, chopped candied ginger, and chocolate. Another new find was the savory buns with cabbage and mushrooms (kapusniaki); yeast dough surrounds a filling of sautéed onions, mushrooms (I used cremini), and sauerkraut. The directions were straightforward and easy to follow; I would recommend letting the rolls rise for at least 45 minutes to an hour on the second rise (the recipe specifies 15 minutes). They freeze very well and make a great snack or side for soup or salad. I also loved the Lublin barley cake (kaszak lubelski) -  the mild flavor of barley, farmer\\'s cheese and orange peel reminded me of an Italian ricotta Easter pie.<br /><br />Ingredients are listed in American measurements and metric; I used the metric measurements when I tested recipes. Patriotic red and white ribbons make it easy to quickly bookmark your favorite recipes. The alphabetical (Polish) list of recipes is somewhat easier to use (and faster) than looking up ingredients in the index: for example, you won\\'t find a listing for cabbage or sauerkraut in the index, though the book includes several recipes featuring them.<br /><br />Beautiful photographs by Simon Target of Polish cities, Christmas markets, various foods and ingredients are interspersed with vintage Polish Christmas cards, advertising, paintings, and bilingual poems and carols that form a time capsule of a bygone Poland.  Many of Beata\\'s family photographs and stories resonated with me, such as the photo of her grandparents\\' evacuation orders (I still have copies of my great-grandparents\\' passports in Russian, as they lived near the border of present-day Ukraine). I know very little of my grandmother\\'s early years in Poland; by reading Beata\\'s stories and looking at the beautiful winter photographs, I could imagine my young grandmother playing in the snowy Polish countryside and running inside for a quick warmup of sauerkraut-filled rolls as Beata herself used to.<br /><br />Part living history, part cookbook, \"Sugared Orange\" is a beautifully crafted tribute to Poland\\'s traditional hearty cuisine and its winter holidays, regional traditions, and sometimes tumultuous history. Poland\\'s once-thriving Jewish population is touched upon; you\\'ll find a recipe and photo for a four-strand challah and photographs of a beautiful Baroque synagogue saved during WWII. Beata\\'s family history and reminiscences of growing up in Poland (she moved to Australia at 19) give context to the many recipes and traditions, and reading (and cooking from) \"Sugared Orange\" is like sipping a cup of tea in a cozy kitchen as you watch the snow fall outside.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Tabula Books)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Good overview of the various military flight aptitude tests',\n",
       "  'text': 'I am a military aviation English instructor (fixed- and rotary-wing) and have spent the past year in charge of an Army rotary-wing aviation project, so I was interested to see the new SIFT (Selection Instrument for Flight Training) that recently replaced AFAST (Alternate Flight Aptitude Selection Test) and test items aimed specifically at helicopter pilots.<br /><br />The first chapters cover the various aircraft flown and aviation training tracks of the various service branches, as well as a brief overview of military ranks, flight pay, benefits, etc.<br /><br />I\\'ve used various commercial study guides for the AFOQT (Air Force Officer Qualifying Test), and the flight-related questions are similar across the different tests in that you\\'ll be asked questions about basic aerodynamics, flight characteristics of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, drawings that test your spatial apperception, and reading and math skills.<br /><br />The book does a good job at describing what is expected for each section of the various flight aptitude tests and includes several practice tests with explanations. Aviation-related info and basic science review is covered in one section, and language and math skills each get their own large chapters in Part II. In addition to the practice tests included in the book, there is also a handy printable cheat sheet available for download on the publisher\\'s website (Military Flight Aptitude Tests for Dummies Cheat Sheet: [...]<br /><br />For those of you who are already in the military, you have free access to additional flight aptitude reviews (AFAST/SIFT, AFOQT, Military Flight Aptitude) via the Peterson\\'s DoD MWR Libraries (Peterson\\'s flight aptitude reviews: AFAST/SIFT, AFOQT, military flight aptitude): [...] that, paired with \"Military Flight Aptitude Tests for Dummies,\" should get you on the right track to achieve your dreams of becoming a military pilot. Of course, prior flight time is a HUGE advantage if you can afford / arrange it; acing the instrument comprehension questions is much easier if you\\'ve actually flown and are used to doing instrument crosschecks.<br /><br />Verdict: \"Military Flight Aptitude Tests for Dummies\" is one of the better military flight aptitude books out there; of course, extra review is helpful as well. For aspiring helicopter pilots, I strongly recommend downloading (and reading) the entire FAA Helicopter Handbook and FAA Helicopter Instructor Handbook ([...] these will give you a solid grounding in rotary-wing theory of flight, flight controls, and flight maneuvers in plain English with plenty of excellent drawings and photos (in fact, we used the FAA materials as the basis for our military rotary-wing aviation curriculum).<br /><br />Good luck and wishing all future aviators blue skies!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Najmieh Batmanglij, the \"guru of Persian cuisine,\" wrote the first edition of Food of Life back in 1986 as a way for her to pass down Persian cooking (and culture) to her sons. More than twenty-five years later, \"Food of Life\" is still going strong and has been given a beautiful update. This anniversary edition includes 330 classical and regional Iranian recipes as well as an introduction to Persian art, history, and culture, new recipes adapted from sixteenth-century Persian cookbooks, added vegetarian options for most recipes, master recipes with photos illustrating the steps, an overview of the long legacy of Persian cooking, and color photos of most recipes with presentation suggestions. A beautiful green ribbon bookmark makes it easy to find your place.<br /><br />In Iran, cooking is not a solitary act meant only to put food on the table, but one that brings family and friends together to laugh, tell jokes and stories, and recite poetry. This expanded edition of \"Food of Life\" is rich with Persian poetry (written in Farsi as well as translated into English) that complements various ingredients, recipes, and lifecycle events. You\\'ll find witty retellings of Mulla Nasruddin that combine food and humor, as well as excerpts from the Thousand and One Nights and early Persian literature. There are also detailed descriptions of various holidays in Iran, as well as the traditional Iranian wedding ceremony with suggestions on how to plan your own. Gorgeous illustrations including miniatures, manuscripts, and reproductions from bas-reliefs provide a glimpse of Persian culture throughout the ages, including lavish court feasts. The food photography is also beautiful, featuring traditional Persian sofrehs and accents. For those new to Persian cuisine, a wonderful list of sample menus is included that covers main meals, Persian holidays and lifecycle events (you\\'ll even find a suggested Persian-American hybrid Thanksgiving menu featuring sweet and sour stuffed turkey and pumpkin khoresh).<br /><br />The recipes are clearly laid out (vegetarian substitutions are printed in green in the margins where applicable) and easy to follow, and I appreciated the thorough glossary of ingredients, terms and Persian cooking techniques, the bilingual English-Farsi list of ingredients and common trees, plants and flowers, as well as the updated list of Iranian stores and restaurants (including internet stores). Though there are certain ingredients that will have to be mail ordered (golpar, grape syrup, dried Persian limes, dried rose petals, mahlab, etc.), most recipes call for ingredients that should be readily available at your grocery store or butcher. Persian cuisine tends to use a large variety of fresh and dried herbs and seasonal vegetables, making it a great way to use up produce from your farmer\\'s market or CSA. I particularly loved the opening chapter of appetizers and side dishes; I like to make two or three and serve them as a light dinner. There are many healthy, tasty yogurt-based dips and salads such as yogurt, cucumber and rose petal dip, yogurt and spinach dip, and yogurt and white broad bean salad as well as cheese, walnut and herb dip, olive salads, and light veggie salads. Stuffed vegetables also play an important role in Persian cooking; I loved the vegetarian version of the quinces with rice stuffing (delightfully sweet-tart from the grape molasses, balsamic vinegar, and lime juice), the stuffed eggplants with walnut and onion stuffing, and the potatoes stuffed with eggs and fresh herbs.<br /><br />Kukus, or open-faced omelets, are another versatile staple that can be served as a snack, appetizer or main dish. They can be served hot or cold and hold in the fridge for several days, making them perfect for a quick leftover meal with a salad. I loved the apple, raisin, and date omelet: I used Fuji apples (but left out the optional cayenne), and I loved the hint of rosewater in the batter. I also tried the pistachio kuku with its side salad of heart of Romaine and dill; I would have never thought to make an omelet with nuts (you grind them with sugar in the food processor first, so there are no large chunks), but it was a very pleasant discovery. Instructions are also included for finishing the omelet in the oven rather than the stovetop (I found that my Le Creuset 10\" cast iron skillet was perfect for this).<br /><br />Another revelation was the fish baked in yogurt with walnut and dill topping. The yogurt kept the fish wonderfully moist, while the walnut topping made with fresh herbs and bread crumbs added a wonderful crunch. There are numerous variations for kababs including lamb, veal, fish, and organ meats, as well as an incredibly thorough  chapter on rice dishes, chelows and polows with fantastic step-by-step photos on how to prepare the tahdig, the golden crust at the bottom of the rice pot that is the most prized part, with no fewer than seven variations. There are even instructions on how to make Persian rice in a rice cooker, a handy touch for busy modern cooks. Polows are one of my favorite things to make as I regularly have many spices and dried fruits on hand, and the many variations using seasonal fruits such as apples and quince make for lots of happy exploring.<br /><br />As a baker, I particularly enjoyed the chapters on desserts, pastries and candies and breads. One of my favorite discoveries was the Armenian sweet bread; I found I had all the ingredients on hand (I used ghee in place of butter) and substituted cardamom for mahlab, and the three resulting loaves looked just like those pictured (see above for photo). Due to it being a very rich dough, the bread does not rise much, but the moist crumb was delicately scented with cardamom and just sweet enough (I used pearl sugar as a garnish). It also freezes well for last-minute company. Chapters on preserves and pickles, drinks (including tea, coffee, and flavored syrups), and snacks and street foods round out the offerings.<br /><br />This beautiful anniversary edition of \"Food of Life\" captures the essence of Iran both ancient and modern, and the book brims with poetry, grace, and the joy of a good meal with family and friends. This is a beautiful tribute to Persian cuisine and culture; the scent of saffron and rosewater seems to rise from its pages, and I find myself coming back to its recipes and stories again and again. \"Food of Life\" holds a place of honor in my cookbook collection, and I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well.

       "  'text': 'François Payard is a third-generation pastry chef (his grandfather owned an acclaimed shop on the Riviera, Au Nid des Friandises) with a string of eponymous bistros as well as a chocolate bar. His gorgeous plated desserts capture the essence of seasonal ingredients in complementary pairings. His philosophy is in using only as many ingredients as are necessary and no more; a great dessert should reflect \"the subtle interplay of flavor, texture  and temperature, along with a streamlined presentation that conceals its complexity.\"<br /><br />This gorgeous volume is clearly aimed at professional chefs (the serving yield is frequently 6-8 servings, and many of the desserts can\\'t be held after assembling) as well as very ambitious home bakers (I would put myself in the latter category). Many of the recipes have multiple components that will need to be prepared / assembled in advance, and like any professional pastry book, a large number of special supplies are required (acetate sheets, chocolate sprayer, whipped cream canister with N20 chargers for creating molecular gastronomy foams, etc.). Similarly, many recipes call for specialty ingredients such as licorice powder, passion fruit puree, pistachio paste, hyssop, silver grade gelatin, etc.<br /><br />The desserts, divided into frozen desserts, fruit desserts, pastries, custards, tarts, and crepes, soufflés and other desserts, are a combination of classical French pastry (vacherin, charlotte, napoleon, apple tatin, tuiles) married to Asian and tropical flavors (star anise, tempura, lemongrass, pineapple). Fresh, seasonal fruit is truly the star, as many recipes call for poached pears, quinces, roasted summer apricots, poached winter fruits, etc. (it would have been helpful to also have a quick index of recipes by season, as there is such an emphasis on seasonal produce for maximum effect). The basic recipes for various base sauces, creams, tuiles, garnishes etc. are straightforward; I liked his take on the chocolate tart dough, which uses a combination of all-purpose and almond flour to add a touch of flaky crispness. Some of the techniques could have benefitted from additional photos, such as the patterned tuile loops on page 27; I had a hard time picturing the steps and had to refer back to the plated photo before I finally \"got\" it (I had to rely on my standby [[ASIN:0471359254 The Professional Pastry Chef: Fundamentals of Baking and Pastry, 4th Edition]] and [[ASIN:0471359262 The Advanced Professional Pastry Chef]] a couple of times for a refresher on technique and plated desserts).<br /><br />Overall, there are plenty of beautiful, delicious pairings to inspire budding pastry chefs; I particularly enjoyed the chocolate shell filled with coconut sorbet and star anise sabayon and the many creative interpretations of cheesecakes and cheese tarts paired with marmalades and roasted fruits, as well as Payard\\'s ideas for the cheese course, including black olive macarons with Gorgonzola ice cream, apple tatin with aged white cheddar cheese, and feta cheesecake with red wine-poached dates. Even if you never make a single dessert, it is a feast for the eyes (and imagination), and the base recipes such as the caramel balsamic sauce, basil oil, and spiced fig pulp, will surely find their way into my kitchen in one form or another!',\n",

Mah\\'s husband, a diplomat, lands a plum assignment to Paris: three years together to explore the city and its many boulangeries, cafes, and markets. An aspiring food writer, Ann is thrilled with the possibilities. They find an apartment and unpack the many boxes that have lived for years in storage (due to her husband\\'s assignments, they have moved around frequently). But the unthinkable happens: her husband is called away to Iraq on a one-year unaccompanied tour, leaving Ann to navigate an unfamiliar language and city.<br /><br />During her year on her own, she traces the origin of various French specialties by heading straight for the source: AAAAA andouillette in Troyes, crepes in Brittany, cassoulet in Toulouse, pistou in Provence, boeuf Bourguignon in Burgundy. Beautifully written and with touches of humor, each chapter concludes with the star recipe that it focuses on. And yes, you\\'ll find healthy sprinklings of wisdom from Julia throughout. There are fascinating cultural tidbits (and lots of dashes of local customs and lore) that serve to spice up the individual stories and portraits of individual regions. And much like a long-simmered cassoulet, all of these elements form a delicious whole.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bev Shaffer\\'s \"Chocolate Desserts to Die For!\" (the fourth book in her \"To Die For!\" series), features more than a hundred recipes for chocolate-infused baked goods, confections, puddings, frozen desserts and drinks rounded out with chocolate trivia, tips, tastings and emerging trends. As if that weren\\'t tempting enough, the pages are generously sprinkled with mouthwatering photos, witty captions and choco-centric quotes.<br /><br />The first fifteen pages or so are dedicated to an eye-opening introduction (\"Many women rank chocolate as the most smile-worthy sight, edging out loved ones\"), chocolate trivia and a brief history of chocolate, how to set up a chocolate tasting, and chocolate baking tips. From the first chapter Comfort Chocolate (is there any OTHER kind?) to party ideas, chocolate gifts (including fudge, caramels, truffles, and homemade marshmallows) and elegant chocolate desserts (white chocolate and Brie cheesecake, bittersweet truffle tart, chocolate orange  pots de crème, white chocolate coeur a la crème with chocolate-covered espresso beans), from white to dark chocolate and every degree in between, you\\'ll be sure to find a dessert with your name on it! For the more adventurous chocoholic, there is chocolate sushi, chocolate fettuccini with whipped cream and fudge sauce, and Chicago-style deep-dish dessert pizza to discover.<br /><br />I made several of the recipes including the chocolate nut tart, chocolate chocolate cocoa cookies, chocolate sorbet (I made mine in popsicle molds like those pictured rather than an ice cream maker; it was divine!), chocolate sauce (only three ingredients - how easy is that?), and chocolate orange pots de crème. The result: BIG chocolate flavor with little effort. For the chocolate sauce, be aware that it will solidify in the fridge, but a quick warmup in the microwave makes it ready for pouring over your favorite ice cream (or as a base for fantastic homemade mochas).<br /><br />The ingredients are commonplace (no fancy restaurant supplies or obscure mail-order ingredients here) and clearly laid out. Most, if not all, recipes are one page; unlike some recent dessert cookbooks I\\'ve reviewed like [[ASIN:1118435893 Payard Desserts]], you don\\'t have to worry about elaborate multi-step, multi-day preparations for the most part (the panna cotta chocolate layer cake Is one of the few exceptions; the cake requires an overnight chill in the fridge before assembling on the second day). There are plenty of simple recipes that the kids can help with (the three-ingredient chocolate sauce or chocolate sorbet would be a great project for young kitchen helpers). And for the grown-ups, there are several boozy creations including a chocolate-infused vodka and baked chocolate espresso shots containing chocolate liqueur.<br /><br />Even if you already own one or more chocolate-themed baking books, you\\'ll pick up numerous tips, tricks, and flavors that will give you new ways to enjoy the \"food of the gods;\" chocoholics rejoice!<br /><br />(A big thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and book blurb!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Throw out what you thought you knew about flavor pairings; Luane Kohnke\\'s \"Sassy Cookies\" will take your taste buds on an extraordinary flavor journey through sweet, spicy, and savory ideas inspired by Latin America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to recipes starring cayenne and cherry, chocolate and ginger, goat cheese and caramel, saffron and pistachio, and green tea and almond, you\\'ll pick up handy tips and techniques for working with a variety of traditional doughs as well as gluten-free macarons, meringues, and cookies.<br /><br />I received a galley of \"Sassy Cookies\" late this spring, and had the chance to make many of the recipes including the chocolate Mexican spice cookies, mocha chocolate wedding cakes, lemon yogurt squares, chocolate-ginger fudge shortbread cookies, gingerbread and pumpkin brownies, mango-coconut bars, flourless peanut butter cookies noir, black mission fig cookies, and fleur de sel cashew cookies. I loved the Asian-inspired green tea macarons and the nod to Latin America in the goat cheese and caramel-swirl brownies (I live in a city with a huge variety of Mexican and Latin American markets, so sourcing cajeta and dulce de leche is no problem!), the Italian-inspired polenta blondies, and the Eastern-inspired chai tea and chocolate butter cookies and cardamom-ginger bars.<br /><br />Recipes are clearly laid out in an easy-to-read font (ingredients are handily printed in contrasting red, baker\\'s notes are in bold), and each recipe comes with a beautiful minimalist photo starring the featured baked good front and center, oftentimes surrounded by an artful deconstruction of its ingredients.<br /><br />I loved that the book includes a wide variety of baked goods, from savories that make great cocktail / appetizer nibbles (black olive bites, blue cheese and cranberry cookies, Parmesan cheese coins with mascarpone filling, savory cheddar cocktail cookies) to sandwich cookies, bar cookies, and a good  number of delicious gluten-free alternatives that don\\'t rely on specialty GF flours or starches (the peanut butter noir and fleur de sel cookies both use a base of nut butter and sugar; the meringues and macarons rely on egg whites and almond flour).<br /><br />My current favorites are the addictive chocolate Mexican spice cookies (with plenty of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherries, and a hint of heat from the cayenne) modeled after Lindt\\'s chocolate, chili, and cherry bar, and the gingerbread and pumpkin brownies, which are perfect for fall. Both received rave reviews from my testers; the next time I make the gingerbread and pumpkin brownies, I am going to add some softened cream cheese to the pumpkin filling and sprinkle some chopped crystallized ginger on top for even more of a ginger kick! The fleur de sel cashew cookies were also a hit; I sprinkled my favorite salt [[ASIN:B006DVQBBM Falksalt Crystal Flakes Natural Sea Salt Natural 4.4 Oz]] on top. These will be an occasional splurge for me, though, as the cheapest jar of organic cashew butter in my neck of the woods goes for close to fourteen dollars! I have plenty of other recipes bookmarked as well that I am eager to try.<br /><br />Verdict: \"Sassy Cookies\" is a must-have in any baker\\'s collection and is sure to spice up your baking!<br /><br />(Thank you to Pelican Publishing for the review copy and for the book blurb!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Lisa Stander-Horel and Tim Horel\\'s \"Nosh on This\" (an update of last year\\'s self-published \"Gluten Free Canteen\\'s Book of Nosh: Baking for Jewish Holidays & More\") is a veritable treasure trove of delicious Jewish-American baked goods like mandelbrot, hamantashen, rugelach, babka, and macaroons rounded out with cupcakes (pumpkin with honey buttercream, dark chocolate cinnamon, cherry chocolate, coconut), donuts, fluffy layer cakes, Danish, éclairs, and Austrian-inspired gems like Sachertorte and Linzer torte. You\\'ll also find several variations of challah and baked savories like kugels, hand pies, latkes, and quiche, as well as homemade confections (peanut butter cups, marshmallows, truffles, and the sinfully delicious coconut matzo rocky road). In addition to being gluten-free, many recipes are dairy-free as well, very handy for those keeping kosher as well as those who are allergic to dairy as well as gluten.<br /><br />I had eagerly awaited this book as soon as I heard it was coming out; in preparation for marathon baking, I stocked up on white and brown rice flour and tapioca starch. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate any local stores selling the recommended Authentic Foods superfine white and brown rice flours and it would have cost me close to $40 to order them online, so I ended up using Bob\\'s Red Mill GF flours. Unlike some GF cookbooks, \"Nosh on This\" does not use any premixed all-purpose mixes containing starches or stabilizers; the base Nosh flour recipe consists of brown and white rice flours and tapioca starch in a 2-1-1 ratio (given by weight and also volume). Most of the Nosh recipes are (xanthan/guar) gum-free as well; several (particularly the bread recipes) call for Expandex Modified Tapioca Starch to help create the \"nice bendy tear\" in traditional breads. Many recipes also layer flavor by combining various extracts (vanilla, orange, almond, lemon). In Lisa\\'s words, \"Baking gluten-free doesn\\'t have to be taste-free or texture-challenged and whenever possible, use chocolate.\"<br /><br />I loved the foreword by Arthur Schwartz (his [[ASIN:1580088988 Arthur Schwartz\\'s Jewish Home Cooking: Yiddish Recipes Revisited]] is a staple in my kitchen) and reading about Lisa\\'s family (\"Oy gevalt - you\\'re so skinny. Nosh something. No one ever died eating two desserts. Nosh on this!\") and the vintage family photos sprinkled throughout. Each chapter kicks off with handy tips and tricks, and each recipe has a chatty intro that\\'s like sitting down with a cup of coffee and a good friend. There\\'s a great Jewish holiday baking chart that lists all the recipes alphabetically along with which Jewish holidays they are suited for. The font is easy to read, and I liked that recipe substitutions were printed in a lighter font (although it was a tad hard for me to read as it was light grey; light blue or a different color might have been easier to read from a cookbook holder). Instructions are clear, and there are gorgeous color photos for each recipe.<br /><br />So far I\\'ve tried three recipes (Mom\\'s double chocolate gelt, marzipany gooey brownies, and chocolate chunk cherry brownies) and have many more bookmarked (flourless chocolate orange cookies, I\\'m looking at YOU). I love to bake, but am fairly new to gluten-free baking, so I stuck to familiar territory (baked goods rather than breads; the bread recipes are more complicated than traditional yeast breads as the dough is more fragile and requires careful handling). I\\'m a chocoholic, and LOVED the double chocolate gelt (next time, I would consider forming the dough into a log, chilling it, rolling it in coarse sugar and slicing it vs. making individual rounds). The brownies were fabulous, especially the marzipan brownies. My only prior experience with GF brownies was from a box mix, and I found it sadly lacking. But these are infused with almondy goodness with the added bonus of mini chocolate chips studded throughout the batter. The macaroons (unlike the recent [[ASIN:1118472160 The Macaroon Bible]] I reviewed as part of Amazon Vine) are conveniently dairy-free (and thus healthier and lighter than using sweetened condensed milk as a binder). One of these days I will work up the nerve to attempt the chocolate babka (the recipe calls for 28 ingredients and spans two pages)!<br /><br />This is one of those rare cookbooks where I actually want to make EVERYTHING (usually I count myself lucky if I tag a handful of recipes out of any given cookbook). You don\\'t have to be Jewish to enjoy this cookbook; this should be in every baker\\'s kitchen (especially if you are new to a gluten-free diet; this is SO much better than premade GF frozen baked goods or GF boxed mixes!) \"Nosh on This\" is perfect for those new to (gluten-free) baking; there are plenty of tips, a \"411\" on frequently-used ingredients, a handy locator list for equipment, ingredients and information, celiac and Jewish baking resources, and the aforementioned Jewish holiday baking chart. This is a blessing for those who are celiac or gluten-intolerant (I count myself in the latter category), or even if you\\'re an experienced (non-GF) baker looking for a challenge and some new, delicious recipes to add to your baking repertoire (I\\'m eager to try the apple upside-down cake with honey pomegranate syrup for fall). Thank you Lisa Stander-Horel and Tim Horel (and their blog Gluten-Free Canteen) for making the delicious Jewish-American treats of our childhoods accessible once again!',\n",

       "  'title': 'Just like babcia used to make!',\n",
       "  'text': \"My babcia (grandmother) hailed from Zwierzyniec, Poland, and my great-grandmother happened to be a cook for wealthy Polish families. I fondly remember my grandmother making delicious sweet yeast breads (raisin, cheese, poppyseed and nut), plum dumplings with a sour cream sauce, crepes with raisins, coffeecakes, and cheesecakes. She would bake with cake yeast and farmer's cheese, making the recipes by feel. One of the great tragedies is that she never wrote down her Polish recipes; I inherited several boxes full of recipes she'd clipped from magazines and newspapers, but never found her recipes for the many wonderful baked goods and Polish comfort food. I have spent the last several years looking for a Polish baking book that would recapture my childhood memories of my babcia's baking, and finally found one in Polish Classic Desserts.<br /><br />Peter Zeranski comes from a well-known name in Polish cuisine; his mother, Alina Zeranska, wrote [[ASIN:0882897098 Art of Polish Cooking, The]], still in print after more than 40 years and the first Polish cookbook I ever owned. Peter and Laura Zeranski's previous cookbook, [[ASIN:1589809610 Polish Classic Recipes (Classics Series)]], was a taste of home for anyone who grew up in a Polish household; staples like barszcz, zurek, bigos, golabki and pierogi (both sweet and savory) were rounded out with traditional sweets like szarlotka (apple squares), babka, poppy seed rolls, and chrusciki (commonly called angel wings), a traditional fried dough served on holidays.<br /><br />Polish Classic Desserts, the sequel to Polish Classic Recipes, provides a wealth of additional Polish baked goods: mazurkas, babkas, cookies, tortes and cakes, pastries and specialty desserts with very little overlap from the first cookbook, making it the perfect companion. Like the first book, it is accessible and a joy to cook from, illustrated with gorgeous full-color photos for each dish. Scattered throughout the book are traditional Polish papercuts (wycinanki), Polish pottery and painted wooden Easter eggs.<br /><br />Polish Classic Desserts enabled me to recreate the wonderful smells and tastes of babcia's kitchen, including kolaczki (these are NOT the same as the Czech kolaches that are staples in Texas; rather, Polish kolaczkis are a rich, flaky cookie with a jam filling) and Polish cheesecake. Fans of yeast breads will find much to rejoice in; there are some unusual babkas such as the saffron baba, enriched with citrus, raisins, and dark rum, as well as my beloved poppy seed rolls. The Fat Tuesday staple paczki, deep-fried jelly doughnuts, make an appearance, as do several other holiday confections like apple raisin cake, holiday gingerbread cake, and harvest cake. Another discovery was the pineapple and walnut bars; I'd fallen in love with a similar version in [[ASIN:1579128815 Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters: More than 100 Years of Recipes Discovered and Collected by the Queens of Comfort Food(TM)]] that used a combination of canned and dried pineapple, but the dried pineapple always seemed too sweet (and too hard). Here the combination of crushed pineapple and a lovely flaky dough make these the perfect breakfast (or anytime) treat.<br /><br />Some of the stories behind the baked goods were especially poignant; I loved reading about how Peter's mother grew her own wedding bouquet and baked her own wedding cake (having never baked before); the staged photo of the finished cake very closely mirrored the photo of his mother's homemade wedding cake on the opposite page. There is also a papal cream cake dedicated to Pope John Paul II; his offhand reminiscence of a boyhood treat sparked a renewed interest in the kremowki (which is basically a napoleon).<br /><br />Polish Classic Desserts offers nearly 50 recipes that will appeal to everyone; in addition to classic Polish yeast breads, cakes, and pastries, you'll find comforting bread puddings, elegant tortes, and a handful of adult beverages to round out the festive offerings. This is a beautiful tribute to the baking of our Polish grandmothers and deserves to be in your cookbook collection!\",\n",

Accurate and timely cultural info is one of the first things I look for, along with detailed descriptions of local cuisine, off-the-beaten path suggestions, and a clean layout with clear maps. I write and design technical books for a living, so I tend to look at layout from a publisher's perspective (fonts, readability, choice of graphics and placement).<br /><br />I've used several Lonely Planet guidebooks in the last two years, so when I opened Lonely Planet Croatia, I was surprised to see the lack of graphics. The only color photos to be found in 346 pages of text are in the first 30 pages. The extremely monochromatic and text-heavy design (printed in a small font) makes for laborious reading (to compare, I read this side by side with [[ASIN:1612381901 Rick Steves' Croatia and Slovenia]], which was inviting and made for fascinating reading cover to cover). This is unfortunate, because there is a wealth of information here: historical and cultural background on Croatia, including a very detailed timeline from 300BC to the present, architecture in Croatia, the environment, etc., but I found I only able to read in limited increments and had to come back to the book later.<br /><br />Descriptions for individual sights / attractions are generally very thorough, labeling each (art gallery, museum, cemetery, etc.). Restaurant options include local Croatian food as well as a mix of international at a range of prices.  There's a young and hip vibe; you'll find sidebars on beach clubbing and the hottest bars. You'll also find handy survival info (local internet access, laundry, medical services, etc.) for each destination as well as a survival guide (with the interesting suggestion of volunteering at a local vulture center or a refuge for young bears) and a whirlwind overview of Croatian. One nice feature is that Lonely Planet Croatia goes into much more detail into areas not frequently visited on group tours (i.e., inland Croatia away from the Dalmatian Coast, such as Slavonia and Zagorje.<br /><br />If the layout had been broken up differently (including more color graphics to break up the monotony of the small font), I feel that this would have been more user friendly. There is a lot of good info here,  but it tends to get lost in the fray. There is also no separate pull-out map as with other Lonely Planet titles I've purchased.

       "  'text': 'I\\'ve had the honor of teaching numerous Iraqi students over the last several years, and they were always eager to share their culture and food with me. I was interested in learning more about Iraqi cuisine, so I was overjoyed to finally receive my copy of the beautiful second edition of Delights from the Garden of Eden. This new edition, which has been several years in the making, features over 300 color photos, the historical and cultural material got a considerable make-over and updates, and measurements are now listed in metric as well as Imperial so readers worldwide can savor the joys of Iraqi cuisine.<br /><br />This beautiful tome is part textbook, part cookbook and covers Iraqi cuisine from the Mesopotamian diet to early Babylonian recipes, cookbooks of the Abbasid Era, and modern interpretations, lavishly illustrated throughout with a combination of calligraphy, manuscripts, photographs, and sketches and paintings by modern Iraqi artists that illustrate every aspect of Iraqi food and its preparation.<br /><br />The first 70+ pages are devoted to illuminating the ancient foodways from which modern Iraqi cuisine descends. In each chapter, there are poems, quotes, and street vendor songs reflecting the importance of various staples in everyday life.<br /><br />Beginning most appropriately with bread, in addition to a basic recipe (and variations) for Iraqi flatbread, you\\'ll find sammoun, Arabic bread (pita), lawash, filled pastries, sweet yeast bread and other delights. There is a whole chapter devoted to vegetarian appetizers and salads, which include familiar staples such as hummus, baba ghannouj, and tabboula alongside Iraqi omelets and flavorful salads (the spicy orange juice salad dressing has become my new standby!), among them a wonderful beet salad dressed with walnuts and yogurt. Many of the recipes are a little lighter and more health-conscious than their original versions (you\\'ll still find plenty of fried recipes if you are so inclined). For the more adventurous, you will find dishes like pacha (head, tripe and trotters), bastirma (stuffed intestines), and beef tongue sandwich.<br /><br />I loved the baked French beans, which are blanched then cooked in a savory custard topped with cheeses and breadcrumbs. These seemingly simple ingredients blossomed when combined to create a delicious savory side dish (or snack). My only recommendation is to use a larger baking dish than called for; the recipe calls for an 8 x 6 inch dish, but the included photo uses a 9 x 13 casserole (I used my [[ASIN:B000JCMPH0 Emile Henry 10-1/2-Inch Oval Au Gratin Azure Blue]] and it was a perfect fit).<br /><br />In the rice chapter, the green rice with fresh fava beans and rice with mung beans made wonderful vegetarian main courses. The chapter on stuffed foods yielded delicate dolmas and kubba, while the port city of Basra offers several excellent shrimp recipes (and I can\\'t wait to try the sweet and sour fish simmered in almond prune sauce!).<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the chapters on savory pastries and desserts, and tried making the olive and cheese bread (pita), apricot balls and lawzeena (almond candy). The olive and cheese bread was a moist, springy dough enriched with yogurt and olive oil and studded with olives, mint, and parsley, making for addictive snacking. The herbs stayed a vibrant green even after being baked into the pita, which makes for a beautiful presentation when sliced into bars as suggested. The apricot balls take only moments to throw together in a food processor, but be sure to use sweetened coconut (snip with kitchen scissors or pulse in the food processor before adding the apricots). My testers said that using unsweetened desiccated coconut, while having the same appearance, resulted in the rosewater being overpowering rather than balancing out the sugar in the coconut.<br /><br />For the almond candy, I tried using both domestic canned almond paste ([[ASIN:B004V7MH1S Solo Almond Paste 8oz]]) and imported almond paste in a tube ([[ASIN:B000DINENE Odense Almond Paste]]). I found that even with kneading, the canned almond paste was too dry and brittle and cracked, allowing the filling to leak out. I had much better luck on my second attempt with the almond paste in a tube, although note that it is 7 oz. instead of 8 oz., so you will want to make a smaller rectangle. Also, make sure that your dough for the almond candy is at least ¼\" thick; the first time I tried to bake this, I rolled it too thinly and the filling punched through and leaked all over the pan! (and the pistachio - confectioner\\'s sugar- rosewater filling makes an addictive candy on its own rolled into balls and chilled!)<br /><br />The recipes have been modified somewhat to fit Western home kitchens; ingredients are given in  Imperial and metric measurements, and some substitutions (particularly for cheese) have been made. I wrote the author about the choices of cheeses recommended in the recipes (including mozzarella and cheddar), and she kindly wrote back with the following: \"Regarding Iraqi cheeses, as I mention in my chapter on dairy products, we have three major cheeses...In my recipes I use feta because it is the closest and most available in the US general stores. However, you might find these days some white Mexican cheeses which might also be used, or if you have access to Middle Eastern stores, you can use Halloom cheese or Akkawi. In my recipes I try to use what\\'s most easily available without compromising authenticity as much as possible.\"<br /><br />As with any international cookbook, you will be making or using many different spice blends, including baharat and za\\'tar. Recipes for the spice blends are given in the glossary. Some recipes also call for noomi Basra (dried lime), amba (pickled mango), and tamarind.<br /><br />There is a very thorough list of scholarly works cited, and not one but several indices as well as a name and subject index. The book itself is very high quality, with heavy matte paper, beautiful photography, and a teal blue ribbon to hold your place. At well over 500 pages, it is a large volume, but lays flat neatly, making it easy to cook from any section. You\\'ll also find a wide variety of sample menus for various occasions, including seasonal menus (among them an Iftar menu for Ramadan), ladies\\' tea parties, and mezze.<br /><br />\"Delights from the Garden of Eden\" is truly a journey; you\\'ll learn about table manners, dining protocol, how the etymology of Arabic food words can be traced back to their earlier roots, the culinary riches and ingenious recipes of medieval Iraqi cooks, and how ancient Mesopotamian customs can be traced to the present. It is a labor of love that illuminates the deep connections between food and culture, past and present, and above all, shows us how much we have in common.  Highly recommended; this should be in every cookbook collection if you are interested in Middle Eastern cuisine! If you already own the original first edition, it is WELL worth purchasing the updated and revised second edition.<br /><br />(Uploaded images for this review can be viewed here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/1845534573/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_all)<br /><br />(Many thanks to author Nawal Nasrallah for answering my questions and Equinox for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Rooster sauce to the rescue - veggie cuisine just got kicked up a notch!',\n",
       "  'text': 'Sriracha has become the latest darling of the culinary world...this addictive blend of chiles, vinegar and garlic is giving traditional hot sauce a run for its money on tables across the country. Hot on the heels of [[ASIN:1607740036 The Sriracha Cookbook: 50 \"Rooster Sauce\" Recipes that Pack a Punch]], Veggie-Lover\\'s Sriracha Cookbook has 50 vegan \"rooster sauce\" recipes from drinks and snacks to soups, salads, main dishes, breakfast ideas and desserts. You\\'ll find something to please every palate; there\\'s a healthy dash of the international, from Middle Eastern muhammara and hummus to the Mediterranean, Latin America, Caribbean, and Asia (pho sure!).<br /><br />One of the greatest features is that yes, this is a vegan cookbook, but each recipe comes with suggestions to adapt recipes for (lacto-ovo) vegetarians as well as gluten-free diets. It\\'s a much-appreciated gesture; I do make vegan dishes from time to time, but I love that the substitutions are right there, so I don\\'t have to mentally convert ground flaxseed and water to egg whites, or ponder how to make gluten-free panko substitutes.<br /><br />I tried four recipes: the Sriracha caponata (page 27), zippy zucchini zuppa with asparagus and cannellini beans (page 36), the Sriracha broccoli slaw (page 47), and the maple-Sriracha roasted Brussels sprouts with cranberry wild rice (page 87). Next up is the warm Dijon-Sriracha potato salad with toasted hazelnuts, spicy tabbouleh-stuffed dolmas, and the super simple peanut butter and Sriracha cookies w/ chocolate chips!<br /><br />For my recipe testing, I used two readily-available brands of Sriracha, the ubiquitous [[ASIN:B0002PSOJW Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 17 Ounce Bottle]] and the new Trader Joe\\'s  Sriracha sauce. Another awesome option is to use [[ASIN:B0006SKCVI Huy Fong Vietnamese Chili Garlic Sauce, 8 Oz.]] or the straight-up [[ASIN:B000F865ZQ Huy Fong Sambal Oelek Ground Chili Paste - 8 oz x 2 bottles]]- all heat, no garlic or spices. There is also a recipe for making your own Sriracha, but as Randy points out, it is cheaper (and easier) to purchase it! The four recipes I tested were all accurate as written and I found the seasoning levels perfect. If you like a hint of heat without going all the way, start out by using half the amount of Sriracha called for and season to taste.<br /><br />The cranberry wild rice is going to be my new Thanksgiving standby; it is an addictive blend of toothsome wild rice, cranberries, chopped pecans, and rosemary topped with caramelized Brussels sprouts (the rice minus the Brussels sprouts would make a great filling for halved acorn squash as a vegan holiday entrée). It also makes a stunning centerpiece if you take the time to arrange the Brussels sprouts in rows across the rice (to see my uploaded images including this recipe, click on the \"see all editorial reviews\" link above). The broccoli slaw was a snap to throw together using bagged broccoli slaw from Trader Joe\\'s; lacking fresh ginger, I threw in some slivered crystallized ginger, and the spicy bite complemented the slaw nicely. The zippy zucchini zuppa was exactly that; I loved the addition of asparagus late in the cooking, as it gave a lovely crunch and color to the soup. The caponata was the first time I\\'d tried making my own at home, and I loved the combination of sweet (from raisins) and tart (cider vinegar, tomato puree, Kalamata olives).<br /><br />Along with Randy\\'s signature humor, I love the fact that he uses his own experiences switching to a plant-based diet to sell the merits of these recipes; I find that nothing turns me off quicker than preachy manifestos disguised as cookbooks! You won\\'t find recipes that used processed TVP meat analogs - no chik\\'n nuggets, vegan corn dogs, or their iffy ilk here, though you will find some tofu-based recipes like Israeli shakshuka, a California Benedict, or quiche Florentine, along with tempeh. If you live in a small town, you may have difficulty finding a few of the ingredients locally, but most ingredients should be easy enough to source or can be ordered online (the most expensive and hard-to-find item here is ackee, or canned jackfruit, used to mimic the texture of pulled pork).<br /><br />The 50 recipes in \"Veggie-Lover\\'s Sriracha Cookbook\" offer tasty and quick ways to add more fresh veggies into your diet with a splash of Sriracha. This is comfort food at its best, from Sriracha-cauliflower mac n\\' cheeze and banh xeo (Vietnamese \"crepes\" filled with savory fillings) to curried kale and squash risotto, to some snappy tipples like watermelon-Sriracha sangria and mango-Sriracha margaritas that are a perfect way to beat the summer heat. Best of all, Randy\\'s recipes inspired me to start creating my own vegetarian Sriracha-spiked creations; yesterday I made killer ice pops by blending a couple of tablespoons of Sriracha with store-bought watermelon agua fresca, poured into [[ASIN:B000G34F2U Tovolo Star Ice Pop Molds, Set of 6, Green]]and froze, and it was awesome!(spicy popsicles are a Mexican staple; chile mango, chile pineapple or chile tamarind are a common sight from pushcart vendors; more spicy pops can be found in [[ASIN:1607740354 Paletas: Authentic Recipes for Mexican Ice Pops, Shaved Ice & Aguas Frescas]]).<br /><br />See my three uploaded images here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/1607744600/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_all<br /><br />Additional recipes and tips can be found on the book\\'s website; see comment below for location.<br /><br />(A huge thank you to Randy Clemens and Ten Speed Press for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'title': 'A beautiful book with simple, fresh preparations and a deep respect for tradition',\n",
       "  'text': 'I had the good fortune to spend six months in Central Japan in 2010-2011; during my stay, I took four Japanese cooking classes in three different cities focusing on traditional cooking methods and regional specialties, including a class led by Elizabeth Andoh (author of [[ASIN:1580085199 Washoku: Recipes from the Japanese Home Kitchen]] and [[ASIN:1580089550 Kansha: Celebrating Japan\\'s Vegan and Vegetarian Traditions]]). The act of making and preparing food according to tradition (including the concept of kansha, or appreciation) was a deeply spiritual journey for me.<br /><br />I contacted Nancy Singleton Hachisu through her blog, and she was kind enough to send a review copy of Japanese Farm Food. When I opened it, it was an instant homecoming for me. Memories of prowling the morning markets at Takayama, admiring the kaleidoscope of pickles at Nishiki Market in Kyoto, or learning about the many varieties of sansai (wild mountain vegetables) at an Osaka department store food hall came rushing back.<br /><br />After a compact look at Japanese farmhouse pantry staples and tools and a handy three-page visual dictionary of cutting and cooking techniques, you\\'ll find the Japanese equivalent of munchies: tsumami. These are simple preparations that showcase the freshness of the ingredients, like ikura (salmon roe),  edamame, eggs pickled in soy sauce, fried fish and Okinawan staple goya champuru (stir-fried bitter melon with egg and red pepper). The pecan miso was an absolute revelation; I used [[ASIN:B0019LA7OI SOUTH RIVER ORGANIC 3-YR BARLEY MISO 1 LB]], and the depth of the flavors was superb. The oil from the pecans (ground to a paste) complemented the salty umami hit from the barley miso and would be great as a dip for raw veggies. The soy sauce eggs make a great snack; these are traditional in homemade bento boxes.<br /><br />One of the great pleasures of any Japanese market or department store food hall is browsing the huge assortment of pickles on display. I loved the section on tsukemono (pickles); these are an essential part of Japanese cuisine. There are several main pickling methods used, including massaging with salt, rice bran (nukazuke), or pickling in vinegar. Here you\\'ll find smashed cucumber pickles with garlic, sweet-vinegared daikon and carrots, young ginger pickled in plum vinegar, and zucchini pickled in rice bran (additional pickle recipes can be found throughout the book). There is an extremely useful guide to vegetables by method at the very back that covers most of the common Japanese cooking/pickling methods.<br /><br />Tofu and eggs get their own chapter; there\\'s a straightforward recipe for homemade tofu and several excellent egg dishes including the traditional rolled omelette, egg custard squares with crab and spinach, and egg custard with flowering mustard in sour orange halves. I loved the idea of steaming chawanmushi in an orange shell instead of the traditional chawanmushi pots; it makes for a beautiful presentation, and the slight hint of citrus in the custard is a welcome addition. (For an excellent and easy primer on making your own soymilk and yuba, I recommend [[ASIN:1580089550 Kansha: Celebrating Japan\\'s Vegan and Vegetarian Traditions]].)<br /><br />Comfort foods also make an appearance, including miso-broiled fish, teriyaki, deep-fried ginger chicken, gyudon and yakiniku. There\\'s a primer on homemade udon and ramen, simple sushi and onigiri preparations, and many vegetarian options (the chapter on vegetables offers nearly *thirty* varieties of salads, tempura, stir fries and simmered veggies). Handy tips and sidebars offer additional suggestions and variations. Various staple recipes such as Japanese mustard, Japanese mayonnaise, dashi, ponzu, and several excellent vinaigrettes and dressings are worth the cost of the book alone (walnut-miso, sesame-miso, tofu-miso, etc.).<br /><br />Along the way, the author frequently reminisces about individual dishes or ingredients, her multicultural family, her encounters with local Japanese farmers and traditional methods, and descriptions of local festivals and disappearing food traditions that read like talking to an old friend.<br /><br />The graphic design also deserves a special mention; ai-zome (indigo textiles) are a visual theme throughout the book, including the beautiful fabric binding. The photos are stunning as well; there are gorgeous glimpses into Japanese gardens, local farmers hard at work in their fields and orchards, scenes of rural festivals and rice pounding, traditional kitchen tools, and closeups of farm-fresh produce as well as finished dishes. Unlike many cookbooks these days, the pages are matte, so glare/slippery pages is not an issue.<br /><br />If I had to sum up Japanese Farm Food in two words, they would be \"simple\" and \"fresh.\" Inside these pages are dozens of simple, tasty ways to prepare seasonal produce; most recipes include only a handful of ingredients and take mere moments to prepare, but the depth of flavor that is achieved (aided by umami in the form of miso and/or soy sauce) is nothing short of amazing. And one of the best parts is that the author calls for far fewer hard-to-find  Japanese ingredients than many other Japanese homestyle cookbooks; this makes a huge difference for items that are not easily substituted (especially fresh vegetables / herbs). This is an absolutely gorgeous cookbook that nourishes the spirit as well as the body.<br /><br />(Arigatou gozaimasu to Nancy Singleton Hachisu and her publicist for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I read the first [[ASIN:030745469X Bruno, Chief of Police: A Novel of the French Countryside]] before a trip to P&eacute;rigord last year, and fell in love with the village of St. Denis, the countryside, the regional gourmet delights, and most of all Bruno himself, a military vet scarred by his time in Bosnia who always has time for a handshake or to hear out a villager\\'s problem.<br /><br />I have not read the other three novels that preceded the Devil\\'s Cave, so I have obviously missed some important backstory from [[ASIN:0307744647 The Crowded Grave: A Mystery of the French Countryside (Vintage)]]) that is referenced throughout the novel, but the rest of the plot was easy enough to follow.<br /><br />A dead woman floating down the river causes quite a stir...not just the fact that she was naked, but that it appeared there were Satanic elements involved in her death. Several of the villagers find this makes for a healthy boost in tourism...much to the chagrin of the mayor, who decidely doesn\\'t want St. Denis known for Satanic rituals. Add in that there is a huge development deal on the table for the village, a hotel compound frequented by defense ministry officials, a mysterious Communist countess, and many other elements that are eventually woven together (some more loosely than others), and it can be quite confusing at times to keep track of it all. Bruno must also deal with some personal drama...his two love interests, the \"mad Englishwoman\" Pamela and the recently wounded policewoman Isabelle, both have commitment issues.<br /><br />The caves of P&eacute;rigord play a starring role here (and this theme is not new to Walker, as evidenced by his earlier [[ASIN:1439181233 The Caves of Perigord: A Novel]]. The countryside of St. Denis is beautiful as usual, but there is so much going on here that there is not much time to leisurely enjoy the town\\'s market days as in [[ASIN:030745469X Bruno, Chief of Police: A Novel of the French Countryside]]. I found the novel\\'s climax to drag on a bit and to test the limits of plausibility. Also, some of the subplots seemed forced and unnecessary and only served to clutter the novel further.<br /><br />Despite these few missteps, I still enjoyed reading of Bruno\\'s adventures and of the reappearance from one of his colleagues from Sarajevo, not to mention the appearance of a new character who quickly stole my heart.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Heartbreakingly profound account of the Wave',\n",
       "  'text': 'I was stationed in Central Japan on March 11, 2011. At first we felt the 2.0 earthquake (we were in a prefecture where small earthquakes are extremely common) and laughed it off until we turned on the TV and sat in mesmerized horror at the brutality of the Wave. Many of my Japan Air Self-Defense Force wingmen were immediately mobilized for search and rescue and recovery efforts, including the monumental cleanup of Matsushima Air Base, which sustained heavy damage. The first week or so after Fukushima was  particularly nerve-wracking; we were constantly getting radiation updates on the TV, small aftershocks happened daily, and supplies started to disappear from grocery stores: first bottled water, then dairy products, then fresh produce. There was serious doubt whether TEPCO and the Japanese government were telling the truth about the scale of the meltdown and amount of radiation leaked.<br /><br />When I had the opportunity to read \"Facing the Wave,\" it took me back to that time of grief and uncertainty, but also Japanese resilience. Haunting in the retelling, this was as difficult to read at times as those live Japanese TV images that will forever be burned into my memory: cars and bridges swept away, giant boats stacked like toys on top of what used to be houses, whole towns wiped off the map.<br /><br />Ms. Ehrlich gives a much-needed human face and a voice to the tragedy. Told in very Zen, minimalist chapters, the book chronicles the stories of numerous Japanese who survived the tsunami from June - December 2011: everyday workers, fishermen, Buddhist abbots and nuns, elderly couples, people from all walks of life who struggle to find a new normal after they have lost their homes, possessions, and family members to the tsunami. There are months of living in crowded shelters, chronic food shortages, attempts to scrub and soak away radiation in Japanese baths, and a typhoon that dumps 17 inches of rain on an already flooded region... but as one elderly geisha relates, \"I lost many things, but I still have the words to the song.\"<br /><br />The personal narratives are rounded out with snippets on the scientific background of the earthquake and tsunami, a much-needed clinical detachment in the face of so much suffering. Snippets of haiku and pertinent quotes are featured regularly. In keeping with the book\\'s Zen aesthetics, there are no photos or illustrations other than a map of the Tohoku region highlighting many of the affected towns that the author visits during the course of her journey. There is also a very handy \"cast of characters\" listed in order of appearance at the end.<br /><br />This was a profound read that captured the spirit of Japan that I know and love so well.',\n",

       "  'text': '\"Comfort food\" can mean many things to many people. In \"Comfort Food Makeovers,\" America\\'s Test Kitchen has once again delivered a winner that has slashed calories and fat from many of our favorite comfort foods without sacrificing taste, texture, or flavor. They manage this by making smart substitutions of lower-fat (and occasionally fat-free) ingredients such as evaporated milk for whole milk or half-and-half in sauces, light cheese, or substituting a more flavorful cheese requiring a lesser amount. Using a variety of techniques including oven baking instead of deep-frying, using glutamate-rich (aka umami) ingredients such as mushrooms, soy sauce, and tomato paste to add a savory depth, and using lean ground beef / poultry. You\\'ll find all your guilty favorites like buffalo wings, coconut shrimp, egg rolls, crab rangoons, and mozzarella sticks given a healthier update.<br /><br />Some of my favorites included their update on the chicken pot pie, a dish that includes poached chicken, a roux, and a puff pastry topping that slashes the calories per serving from 610 to 340 and cuts fat from 36 to 13 grams, and I also loved the baked stuffed shrimp, which uses chopped shrimp and panko crumbs to create a low-fat filling with big flavor. There were a lot of appealing desserts and breakfast items that I\\'ve flagged to try later, including several stratas, frittatas, and icebox pies.<br /><br />Full nutritional info is provided (each recipe also provides a before-and-after analysis), along with ample color photos and conversions and equivalencies. The one area that seemed sparser than normal was the list of suggested brands and equipment (there are three pages total devoted to this in the very front). Overall, this is a great way to eat healthier while still enjoying the foods you love; it\\'s not a \"diet\" book by any means, but I loved that the comfort foods still taste like comfort food, and that many traditional recipes as well as ethnic favorites were represented.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I was looking for more ways to fire up my Weber grill, and was excited when I was offered \"100 Grilling Recipes You Can\\'t Live Without.\" The book begins with a VERY brief discussion on two-level grilling, gas vs. charcoal, time and temperature, and tips for success, then plunges right into the recipes. You\\'ll find a sampling of appetizers like grilled cheese sandwich on a stick, Moroccan chicken wings, goat cheese wrapped in grape leaves, and margarita shrimp. There\\'s a chapter devoted to party-time pizzas (think clam and sausage, Pecorino pizza with artichokes, and blue corn and green chile pizza), burgers and dogs (including a nod to Chicago legend Berghoff!), fajitas and tacos, steaks, chops and ribs, poultry, seafood, veggies and desserts.<br /><br />There are only a handful of recipes for each (brief) chapter, and no photos or index in my ARC, so I can\\'t comment on those items. Some of the recipes were more \"adventurous\" than the casual grill fare I was looking for (elk backstrap medallions, quail, lobster), but others like the grilled fruit desserts were a helpful addition to some of my other grill cookbooks (pina colada pineapple spears, grilled peaches with gorgonzola, honeyed figs). Having a range of options from casual to more upscale is a nice touch that allows you to prepare as simple (or elaborate) a cookout as you wish. The authors recommend using heritage pork loin, split tails from warm-water lobsters over a cold-water lobster,  and other useful hints that I haven\\'t seen in some of my other grilling titles. Along the way you\\'ll find grilling tip sidebars with additional helpful hints.<br /><br />This is a nice grilling book, but if you\\'re brand-new to the grill, I\\'d recommend [[ASIN:0376020598 Weber\\'s Way to Grill: The Step-by-Step Guide to Expert Grilling (Sunset Books)]] or [[ASIN:0761120149 How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

       "  'text': 'For a world-renowned cooking school with an illustrious history, \"In the Kitchen With Cordon Bleu\" can feel like a book club publication. As other reviewers have mentioned, the book itself feels somewhat cheap, with an ill-fitting cover that doesn\\'t quite cover the edges of the pages. The book contains recipes from each of Le Cordon Bleu\\'s campuses around the globe and is the first of a series.<br /><br />As for the recipes themselves, they run the gamut from classical French (parmentier of duck confit, beef daube, cassoulet) to world influences (wasabi-crusted chicken breast with rice noodles, Kashmiri style chicken korma, shrimp, mango and cashew salad, etc.).<br />Despite the fact that this is marketed towards home cooks, many of the recipes are time-consuming / labor-intensive and call for expensive and hard-to-find ingredients (Wagyu beef, truffles, veal stock, etc.), but that is to be expected to a degree. These recipes are clearly aimed at advanced home cooks; if I want to eat the sort of food in \"In the Kitchen with Cordon Bleu,\" I\\'ll make a reservation for an upscale restaurant.<br /><br />Many of the photos are filler, featuring black-and-white artistic closeups on kitchen utensils or hands rather than illustrating techniques or finished dishes (there are fewer than 40 recipe photos for 100 recipes in the book).

       "  'title': 'A lifesaver in the guise of a \"cookbook\"',\n",
       "  'text': 'Let it be said that I ordered the book based on its cover; as an ESL/EFL language specialist and diehard foodie and cookbook collector (my collection of cookbooks numbers over 200 and growing), I loved the concept of a literacy \"cookbook\" complete with \"doggie bag\" sidebars and chapters arranged by \"basic ingredients,\" \"entrees\" (tasty persuasive writing, reading, writing and test prep \"stew\"), and \"desserts.\" But far from a gimmick, \"The Literacy Cookbook\" has proven to be a lifesaver for a particular student I\\'ve been working with.<br /><br />I have a master\\'s degree in TESOL, but much of my coursework was theoretical (and my bachelor\\'s was in French, Spanish and Japanese, so I don\\'t have an education background to fall back on). Other than some PhD-level classes in reading and vocabulary acquisition theory, I was lost in reaching out to adult second language learners who struggled with reading in English (and for many of our Saudi students, this is a persistent problem).<br /><br />Although it\\'s aimed at K-12 students, \"The Literacy Cookbook\" is applicable just as easily to adult learners. I found Sarah\\'s advice on teaching paraphrasing particularly helpful, as that is what my current student was struggling with. I loved her emphasis on building knowledge of word roots; that\\'s something I do frequently in my own EFL/ESP classroom, but many of my students don\\'t have much practice analyzing and breaking down words in English. And for second language learners, having them \"draw\" idioms is a great tool for visual learners to \"lock in\" the meaning.<br /><br />In addition to mini-lessons, along the way there are multiple sample worksheets to help students with inferences, reading from context, transitions, checklists, organizers, citations and more illustrated with cute food-themed line drawings (although I admit the frequent sports analogies went over my head!). You\\'ll find advice on teaching with novels, book talk projects, training students to listen and speak effectively, test prep tips and more that will empower your students to become strong readers and speakers. This is one book I wish I\\'d had when I started teaching, and all new teachers should have this in their arsenal!!',\n",

       "  'title': 'The \"incredible edible egg\" in all its guises',\n",
       "  'text': '\"How to Boil an Egg\" is the follow-up to the lovely [[ASIN:0714844659 Breakfast, Lunch, Tea: The Many Little Meals of Rose Bakery]], the first collection of recipes from Rose Bakery. This latest installment is dedicated to turning the egg (\"nature\\'s humble hero\") into breakfast, lunch, or tea. The title itself is tongue-in-cheek, as there is only a very brief one-page overview of various egg-cooking methods (boiled, poached, scrambled, fried, omelette) before launching into breakfast offerings (including standards such as eggs Benedict, Egg In the Middle and French toast along with delightful alternatives like Eggs Baked in Dashi and Scrambled Eggs with Tomato), scones and muffins, and pancakes, popovers, and oats. The various sections are full of quick, easy recipes that all star eggs in some form or another, whether it\\'s a gratin studded with roasted veggies, lacy strips of eggs over veggies, curried (and other) egg salads, moist quick breads, or silky flans, puddings or custards (there\\'s even a dairy-free soy crème caramel option).<br /><br />I tried making the chocolate orange muffins in two different incarnations, one with low-fat sour cream and Splenda and one as written. I also added about ½ cup chopped candied orange peel to the batter, and it made a wonderful counterpoint to the chopped chocolate studded throughout. The sour cream results in a moist (but not wet) springy batter, while the chopped chocolate (and candied orange peel) added a nice contrast of texture. Note that the 6- 8 muffin yield seems to refer to panettone-style paper muffin cups like [[ASIN:B002JPJ0P0 Kitchen Supply Mini Panettone Paper Mold, Set of 25]], as I easily got 12 full-sized muffins out of my [[ASIN:B001IANICS USA Pans 12 Cup Cupcake/Muffin Pan, Aluminized Steel with Americoat]].<br /><br />The next recipe I tried was from the Lunch section; having lived in Japan, I am addicted to the delicate steamed egg custard known as chawanmushi and brought home a set of lovely blue chawanmushi cups. I was thrilled to see not one, but several chawanmushi recipes here, and chose the \"My Chawanmushi with Spring Vegetables.\" Most chawanmushi cups I\\'ve seen hold between 4 - 8 oz. of liquid. I filled four of my chawanmushi cups with the stock and veggies and still had an additional cup of custard left over, so you may want to try cutting the amount of stock in half. Also, the chawanmushi recipes call for tasting the raw custard for seasoning before steaming; I skipped that step. The resulting custards were wonderfully creamy and full of little morsels of spring goodness. **There appears to be a typo in the recipes for gratins on pages 60-61; the recipe intros mention using \"4 pretty cups or heatproof bowls and a steamer,\" but this actually refers to the chawanmushi recipes on pages 77-78. The rest of the gratin recipes reference baking the veggies and eggs in an ovensafe dish.**<br /><br />Finally, I tried the Pumpkin Cake and the Semolina Custard from the Eggs for Tea chapter. I chose to make the pumpkin cake in the form of muffins, and the recipe yielded 20 standard muffins. The cake calls for olive oil, which loaned a fruity softness to the muffins, and the recipe calls for apple pie spice and cinnamon. **Note that the equivalent measurement for the pumpkin puree is not accurate; it calls for 2 cups pumpkin puree (with its original metric measurement of 425 grams); one can of pumpkin is exactly 425 grams, which yields about 1 ¾ cups. I felt like 2 cups of packed pumpkin, plus the 1 cup of olive oil and the ½ cup water, would result in too wet a batter, so you may want to go by the metric measurements if something seems a little off.**  I made the optional white chocolate drizzle and topped with toasted pumpkin seeds as pictured. The Semolina Custard comes with a lovely citrus glaze that is also fantastic as a marinade for tofu or chicken!<br /><br />Overall, \"How to Boil an Egg\" contains more wonderful recipes from Rose perfectly suited for a light lunch or afternoon tea. Rather than use photos, the book is gorgeously illustrated with photorealistic watercolors by award-winning botanical artist Fiona Strickland. Most of the ingredients should be easy enough to find in your supermarket other than one or two exceptions like matcha, dashi, or purple corn powder, and the results were delicious and simple enough that I would make them on a regular basis. This is comfort food at its best, and fans of Rose Bakery will certainly want to add this to their cookbook collection.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Phaidon Press)',\n",

       "  'title': 'A haunting YA novel about the cost of war',\n",
       "  'text': 'Packed with symbolism, Operation Oleander is a riveting read and one that doesn\\'t sugarcoat the realities of deployment and its impact on soldiers, their families, and communities.<br /><br />I\\'d ordered Operation Oleander just as the recent news story broke a suicide bomber attacking a convoy of US soldiers, diplomats, and DoS civilians who were delivering books to a school in Afghanistan. In Operation  Oleander, Jess Westmark and her friend Meriwether Scott, both of whom have parents deployed to Afghanistan, start a charity to collect money and school supplies for a Kabul orphanage. Their parents and others from their unit are directly involved in delivering donated supplies to the orphanage. But things go horribly wrong when the soldiers\\' convoy is bombed, killing and wounding several Fort Spencer soldiers and Afghan civilians. Meriwether\\'s mom is killed and Jess\\'s father is seriously wounded in the attack. Suddenly Jess and her Operation Oleander are under fire; did her charity needlessly jeopardize the lives of American soldiers?<br /><br />I found that Jess\\'s narrative really rang true for me; after her mother flies to Germany, she tries to mend her relationship with Meriwether and to soul search about the future of Operation Oleander; she\\'s received a direct order to stand down by the post\\'s commander. She tries to emulate her father in times of crisis: \"Straighten up. Stay calm. Keep order.\" Duty, honor, country. Jess has to learn to make her own way and do what she feels is right.<br /><br />The novel introduces many elements of military life: deployment, the PX, base housing, military customs and courtesies, etc. It\\'s great to see these things mentioned in a YA book when there are more than 1 million military kids living this reality every day. Most bases and posts offer some kind of \"deployment camps\" or support groups for younger kids, but for teenagers already going through a lot of changes (the constant reassignment to other posts / bases / schools, not to mention the stress of having a family member deployed, sometimes for several consecutive tours), Operation Oleander may be of some comfort to have a narrator in the same situation.',\n",

       "  'title': '\"Arabian Nights\" will infuse your kitchen with the captivating aromas of the Middle East',\n",
       "  'text': 'Over the past several years, I\\'ve taught hundreds of students from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE, and they were eager to share their native cuisine with me; we would frequently have Saudi coffee breaks with homemade pastries courtesy of their wives, or talk about the finer points of making kabsa or hunting for desert truffles. I was interested in learning more about these dishes, but found that most recent cookbooks on Middle Eastern cooking were focused more on Turkey, Morocco, Syria, or Iran with the exception of one or two recent releases like [[ASIN:1566568498 Cardamom and Lime: Recipes from the Arabian Gulf]].<br /><br />I own Habeeb Salooum\\'s excellent [[ASIN:1566563984 Classic Vegetarian Cooking from the Middle East and North Africa]], so I was very interested to see his \"The Arabian Nights Cookbook.\" \"Arabian Nights\" revisits and  expands upon several Gulf favorites first introduced in his \"Classic Vegetarian Cooking\" and includes the many chicken, lamb and seafood dishes found in the Gulf, including kabsa, al-mandi, zurbian, laham (mini Saudi pizzas that are distinct from their Syrian cousins), and several Indian-inspired fish preparations including a Kuwaiti fish curry.<br /><br />In \"Arabian Nights,\" you\\'ll find numerous suggestions from appetizers to Gulf-style coffee and beverages  to round out  your meal (although strangely there is no mention of Saudi coffee made with freshly roasted green coffee beans) and sweets including baklava, a heavenly cardamom-scented fruit salad, fritters and other fried desserts, and rosewater-scented custards and puddings. Most recipes here use at least ½ stick of butter or ¼ cup of oil for the rice dishes, and there are many fried dishes, but there are also a wide variety of fresh, delicious vegetable salads, pickled veggies, and yogurt-based dips and drinks represented, so you can assemble your own Arabian-inspired meal however you wish (including vegetarian, as there are many wonderful salads, soups, breads and rice dishes to choose from).<br /><br />The book begins with a compact illustrated glossary of useful tools and implements (particularly related to brewing and serving Gulf-style coffee) and an illustrated list of essential Arabian ingredients that gives names in English and Arabic. Several basic recipes including pickled garlic, strained yogurt and tangy hot tomato sauce set the stage. You\\'ll find many familiar dishes that have migrated to the Gulf such as baba ghanouj, muhammara, hummus and tabbouleh, a lovely orange and olive salad originally from Morocco, and many imports by way of India: baqoura (pakoras), samboosak (samosas), curries, etc. Each recipe gives a brief history of the dish and its origins, along with preparation tips and hints.<br /><br />I tried several of the recipes including Mung Beans and Rice with Almonds, Aromatic Rice with Almonds, Sweet Holiday Biscuits, Sweetened Vermicelli Omelet, Olive and Orange Salad, Zesty Tomato and Fresh Coriander Salad, and the Refreshing Green Salad. The first time I made the Mung Beans and Rice with Almonds, I followed the recipe exactly, and I found the cooking time FAR too long (25 minutes at a simmer followed by 30 minutes to steam off the heat): the rice had disintegrated into a glutinous paste rather than fluffy separate grains. I tossed out the first batch and started over, but this time I used the directions from the Aromatic Rice with Almonds, fusing the two recipes (I added raisins with the mung beans and used the larger quantity of almonds), which only has you cook the rice for 12 minutes before steaming for 30. This time, the rice was fluffy and perfectly cooked, so I would start with half the cooking time if you\\'re following the recipe for Mung Beans.<br /><br />I also enjoyed learning to make Arabian breads like sweet holiday biscuits (khubz mohala), a yeasted dough sweetened with date syrup (I made my own using the instructions in the sidebar) that makes a lovely accompaniment to coffee and dates. The dessert section contains standards like baklava as well as a cardamom-scented fruit salad with a fabulous cardamom honey dressing that\\'s great on any kind of fruit.<br /><br />The instructions are straightforward and most of the ingredients should be easy to find, although you may have to mail order some of the spices such as za\\'tar, sumac, date syrup and rose / orange blossom water depending on whether you have any Middle Eastern / Indian markets in your area. The book is gorgeous to look at as well; there are photos for nearly every recipe, as well as some step-by-step photos for the more difficult ones (stuffing lamb / veal). There is also a suggested resource guide arranged by geographic regions of the U.S. and Canada. The index includes English recipe titles only.<br /><br />Mr. Salloum has created a wonderful, compact introduction to Gulf cooking that is accessible by all levels of home chefs; most importantly, his recipes are practical for home kitchens (my students used to regale me with tales of roasting a whole camel in a pit in the Saudi desert; luckily the largest thing in this cookbook is the roast leg of lamb!). \"The Arabian Nights Cookbook\" will infuse your kitchen with the captivating tastes and aromas of the Arabian Gulf and add a whole new layer of flavor to your repertoire!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Tuttle Publishing)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Leans much more towards French flavors than Japanese ones, but a good resource for patisserie',\n",
       "  'text': 'I was stationed in Japan for six months in 2011, and during that time, I had the opportunity to sample numerous gorgeous (and delicious) French pastries and breads, including Maison Kayser. The Japanese are particularly fond of genoise(sponge cakes), particularly cream-and-fruit-filled cake rolls, as well as macarons, cream puffs, and financiers. Chef Yamashita is a pastry chef who originally owned a very successful pâtisserie in Nara, Japan, and now owns Flor Pâtisserie in Singapore.<br /><br />I own [[ASIN:9812617809 Okashi Treats: Sweet Treats Made With Love]] by the same publishing company, and while \"Okashi Treats\" experiments with traditional Japanese flavors like black sesame, green tea, sweet potato, and red bean paste, the author also branched out into apple and mincemeat tartlets, a pine nut tart, carrot, ginger, and rum raisin cake, and dog treats!<br /><br />Both cookbooks (Tanoshii and Okashi Treats) contain the same staples: short crust, cream puff dough, custard sauce, etc. but Tanoshii plays it much \"safer,\" with only ONE green tea-infused recipe and hojicha butter castellas. However, Yamashita-san\\'s dacquoise aux raisins is superb, and his cayenne pepper cookies will be familiar as that Southern classic cheese straws (you could also use curry powder to give it a more \"Japanese\" twist). The only semi-exotic nod comes in the form of the coconut gula melaka madeleines made with palm sugar and coconut. I would have liked to see more recipes that played with black sesame, various teas, and red bean paste, as these are flavors I sampled frequently at the many French-inspired pastry shops in Japan. I found it curious that when I looked at the product list for Flor Pâtisserie, there were many more \"Japanese\" flavors than are featured in the cookbook (marron pie, tofu chiffon cake, Earl Grey and green tea cakes, azuki cake, sesame cookies, matcha butter cake, etc.); this is more of what I\\'d hoped to find in Tanoshii (the recipes themselves weren\\'t available for the \"Look Inside This Book\" feature; if I\\'d known this before I ordered, I would have probably passed it up).<br /><br />Tanoshii also includes several chocolate desserts (chocolate almonds, brownies, chocolate gateau) and jellies (grapefruit jelly, champagne jelly, avocado mousse, etc.)<br /><br />If you are looking for a very clear, fairly simple guide to French-style patisserie, then Tanoshii is a good choice (each step has a photo), but I find the subtitle \"Joy of Making Japanese-Style Cakes and Desserts\" a bit misleading, since [[ASIN:9812617809 Okashi Treats: Sweet Treats Made With Love]] Made With Love more closely mirrored what I saw in the numerous pastry shops I frequented in Japan. Ideally, I would recommend purchasing both books; Tanoshii for its base recipes, and Okashi Treats once you\\'re ready to branch out.  I hope that Chef Yamashita will release a second cookbook that  includes more of the Japanese-style treats that he serves at Flor!',\n",

       "  'text': 'I hadn\\'t read the first books in the series ([[ASIN:1400077087 Portuguese Irregular Verbs: A Professor Dr von Igelfeld Entertainment Novel (1)]], [[ASIN:B000XUAE6C The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs: A Professor Dr von Igelfeld Entertainment Novel (2) (Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld)]], [[ASIN:B000XUDGJO At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances: A Professor Dr von Igelfeld Entertainment Novel (3) (Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld)]]), so perhaps that explains some of my confusion, but I found \"Unusual Uses for Olive Oil\" to be disjointed and a little dull. The \"novel\" is actually a collection of independent short stories (emphasis on the \"short\").<br /><br />Professor Dr von Igelfeld is the prototypical Aspie: wrapped up in his own little corner of academia at Regensburg\\'s Institute of Romance Philology, he interprets everything literally, has difficulty interacting with people, and manages to say and do the wrong thing in awkward social situations (and naturally, he doesn\\'t realize the jokes are at his expense). The author of \"Irregular Portuguese Verbs,\" he is engaged in a bitter rivalry with fellow Professor Dr. Dr. Detlev-Amadeus Unterholzer and finds himself seeking escape from the dull musings of Herr Huber, librarian, who pontificates endlessly on the state of affairs at his aunt\\'s nursing home.<br /><br />The sad, insecure lives of Professor Dr von Igelfeld and his colleagues were depressing; particularly the final chapter which stars the one-legged dachshund Walter pictured on the cover. Despite the obvious comedic setups, I found very little that was actually amusing as it was easy to predict in advance. If you\\'re a fan of satires of academia, this may appeal to you, but I\\'ll stick with the No. 1 Ladies\\' Detective Agency novels.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Much like its predecessor [[ASIN:1589808975 Scandinavian Classic Baking]], \"Scandinavian Classic  Desserts\" will open up your kitchen to the tastes and smells of Scandinavia, a journey that will include cardamom-scented pound cakes, creamy baked puddings, jewel-like cookies and mini-tarts, and a variety of desserts made with fresh berries and fruit. You\\'ll find favorites like Norwegian blotkake, frystekake, Mazarin tarts, Danish aeblekage, Swedish spritz cookies, several varieties of aebleskiver, rosettes and krumkake; there\\'s even some Swedish glogg to round out the offerings!<br /><br />The recipes were clearly written and easy to follow using commonplace pantry ingredients (most call for only a handful of ingredients) other than Swedish pearl sugar, which can be ordered online. Each recipe is written in a different color, which makes it easy to keep track of which recipe you\\'re making. As with the previous book, there is gorgeous full-page photography for nearly every recipe, as well as unique sidebars with photos that give more information about a particular Scandinavian city, tradition, or ingredient.<br /><br />I tried making several of the recipes including the Finnish orange cake (p. 15), chocolate almond torte (p. 23), cherry pancake pudding (p. 39), and baked rice pudding (p. 41; see photos above). For the Finnish orange cake, I tried two different versions: one as written, and one \"light\" version using Splenda and low-fat sour cream. Both were excellent! The moist, dense crumb is heavily scented with orange and perfumed with cardamom (for best results, buy green cardamom pods and grind the seeds yourself, as ground seeds start to lose potency immediately as the oil is exposed to the air). I baked it in my [[ASIN:B0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf]] to create a more festive-looking loaf appropriate for a teatime table.<br /><br />The next recipe I tried was the chocolate almond torte, which handily catered to both my gluten-free coworkers as well as those observing Passover (it\\'s a flourless cake that uses almond flour as a thickener). The flavor was fantastic: strongly chocolatey without being overpoweringly sweet. This is great with a dollop of unsweetened freshly whipped cream and fresh berries! (It is, however, a rather messy treat to cut and serve, as the moist chocolate crumbles everywhere.)<br /><br />The baked rice pudding was very close to one my Polish grandmother made. I used Arborio rice, as it was what I had on hand, and the rice cooking directions were spot-on. Despite using four cups of milk, this makes a firm, creamy pudding that isn\\'t soupy in the slightest. I happened to use dried Bing cherries in place of raisins, and the plump, slightly tart cherries complemented the pudding nicely. I also added a sprinkle of cardamom and cinnamon to the top of the pudding halfway through baking, and then stirred it in as the pudding continued to bake (my grandmother\\'s recipe always used ground cinnamon and nutmeg on top). Finally, the cherry pancake pudding is essentially a French clafoutis (a thickened custard studded with cherries). This makes a really lovely breakfast treat that takes only minutes to throw together!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic cookbook that produces easy, consistent results that are a nice change of pace from my usual quick breads and muffins. I took this book to work, and my coworkers all wanted to borrow it to try out many of the recipes themselves! Whether you\\'re looking for an elegant yet simple seasonal dessert or to reconnect with your Scandinavian roots, \"Scandinavian Classic Desserts\" is a winner!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Pelican Publishing)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Pati Jinich, a native of Mexico City, proves a most engaging guide to homestyle Mexican dishes from street foods to colonial gems, Middle Eastern influences to comfort foods from across Mexico: you\\'ll find references to Guadalajara, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Michoacán, the Yucatan Peninsula and Mexico City. Her PBS show Pati\\'s Mexican Table features two seasons of episodes that revolve around a certain ingredient, holiday, or theme.<br /><br />I was lucky to receive a review copy of \"Pati\\'s Mexican Table; The Secrets of Real Mexican Home Cooking\" several weeks ago courtesy of Pati\\'s publicist, and in that time I\\'ve tried several recipes from the various sections, including two of the salads (red leaf, avocado, and grapefruit salad with olive-mint vinaigrette and the spinach goat cheese salad with caramelized pecans and jamaica vinaigrette), a soup (Mexican alphabet soup), several of the egg dishes (huevos rabo de mestiza, Mexican frittata with poblanos, potatoes, and feta), and two of the desserts (triple orange Mexican wedding cookies, Alisa\\'s marbled pound cake). I also made the tamarind, apricot and chipotle sauce for use with another dish.<br /><br />Pati\\'s easygoing manner and clear explanations translate well to the written page; many of the recipes in \"Pati\\'s Mexican Table\" come complete with a \"Mexican Cook\\'s Trick\" sidebar with the types of tips that add an extra layer of authenticity: you\\'ll find tips on enhancing the flavor of cucumbers by rubbing them with the cut ends, that your masa should have the consistency of Play-Doh, tips on working with tortillas before adding sauce, and using rice flour in tortes. These little tidbits are the types of things that you don\\'t often find in cookbooks, and it\\'s a nice touch that makes you feel like you\\'re being let in on a family secret.<br /><br />The recipes are clearly laid out and easy to follow. You\\'ll find show favorites like Chicken with Tamarind, Apricots and Chipotle Sauce, Chicken À La Trash, Mexican Meatballs with Mint and Chipotle, and Steak Tacos with Jamaica-Jalapeño Sauce, along with vegetarian-friendly recipes, some kid-friendly recipes, and even a few gluten-free recipes to boot. There are also some international dishes like watermelon and tomatillo salad with feta cheese, tomato and mozzarella salad with pickled ancho chile vinaigrette, and crab cakes with jalapeño aioli that are given a fun Mexican-inspired twist.<br /><br />I loved the unique salad dressings like the olive-mint vinaigrette and the hibiscus flower vinaigrette; these will become a regular staple in my kitchen. I found that for two of the dishes I tried, the Mexican alphabet soup and the triple orange Mexican wedding cookies, that I made a few small tweaks to the recipes as written.  There\\'s a good sampling of recipes taken from the show\\'s two seasons; I did a quick scan on the show\\'s website, and it would appear that at least one recipe from each show made it into the cookbook. I did miss seeing a few of my show favorites like Juju\\'s birthday cake and the blackberry pecan tamales, but you can quickly and easily print these out at the show\\'s official website. Gorgeous photography and a user-friendly bilingual index (Spanish recipe titles are printed in italics) round out the book. No nutritional info is provided.<br /><br />Many recipes call for a variety of fresh and dried chile peppers (poblano, jalapeño, serrano, guajillo, chipotles in adobo) and Mexican grocery staples like piloncillo, flor de jamaica and masa, but the majority of ingredients should be readily available in your grocery store.<br /><br />Verdict: Fans of Pati\\'s TV show and those looking for an easy, tasty introduction to homestyle Mexican cooking will be sure to enjoy \"Pati\\'s Mexican Table: The Secrets of Real Mexican Home Cooking\" (let\\'s hope there are many more seasons and a second cookbook to boot!). ¡Provecho!<br /><br />Review copy courtesy of Pati\\'s publicist - ¡muchas gracias!',\n",

       "  'title': 'A nice companion piece to the French and Italian Slow Cooker books; shines for desserts',\n",
       "  'text': 'I own both of Michele\\'s [[ASIN:054700303X The Italian Slow Cooker]] and [[ASIN:0547508042 The French Slow Cooker]] books, and they are in frequent rotation in my [[ASIN:B0026A7GRM Hamilton Beach Premiere Cookware 5-1/2-Quart Slow Cooker]] for their winning combination of authentic flavors and relatively easy prep.<br /><br />I preordered her latest, Mediterranean Slow Cooker, and quickly bookmarked several recipes that caught my eye. In the French Slow Cooker, Michele demystified soufflés for the slow cooker. Here, you\\'ll find a variety of egg dishes like spinach and feta omelet, spicy vegetable eggah, Israeli breakfast favorite shakshouka, and a delicate green bean and scallion torta that would all make fantastic brunch options.<br /><br />The poached salmon in court-bouillon was a winner, especially when paired with the suggested tzatziki, and the shrimp with tomatoes and feta (my personal preference was to switch out the white wine in the sauce for red) was also a favorite. The crunchy mustard chicken diable has the ingenious solution of slow-cooking bone-in chicken thighs, then toasting panko on the stove and coating the chicken at the last minute so the topping remains crunchy (this would make a great picnic dish!). And the pork ragu with broken lasagna Maialino-style was an unexpected gem; the simple sauce is served over irregular sheets of lasagna noodles tossed with Parmigiano and arugula. Fans of lamb will find plenty to rejoice over, including numerous Greek recipes like Bandits\\' Lamb (stuffed with salty Greek cheese) and Middle Eastern lamb and pine nut meatballs.<br /><br />Vegetarians will also find some offerings, such as red lentil soup, winter squash and chickpea soup, polenta with herbs, wheat berry tabbouleh, bulgur and toasted walnut pilaf, and farro with spring vegetables. Like her other slow cooker cookbooks, you\\'ll also find \"out of the pot\" recipes that use precooked beans, etc.; here these offerings include a Greek country chickpea salad, hummus, and Turkish beet and goat cheese dip.<br /><br />For me, the real star of the book was the desserts. The entire section is crammed full of intriguing finds, like several Greek-inspired cakes (sunny orange cake with orange syrup, walnut cake with cinnamon syrup), decadent cheesecakes (the first recipe I tried was the awesome cannoli cheesecake; see above for a photo) including Nutella, several flans, bread puddings, and fruit (blushing pomegranate pears, warm fruit compote with mascarpone sauce).<br /><br />This is a worthy investment if you enjoy Italian, Spanish, and Greek food, and most of the ingredients should be easy to find at your local supermarket. Yes, there is some prep involved in the chopping and sautéing of veggies (and browning of meat) before cooking, but this adds a wealth of flavor to the final dish that is well worth the extra time (and if you have a slow cooker with a metal insert, you can sauté and cook in the same dish). The desserts alone are worth the cost of the book; Michele taught me that I can make showstopping cheesecakes in my slow cooker, a trick I never would have thought to try on my own! (I used [[ASIN:B000237FS0 Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch]] set on a [[ASIN:B005FPD6VA Spice Ratchet 16812 Blossom Multi-Use Silicone Trivet, Black]]).<br /><br />**Update 1/20: In addition to the cannoli cheesecake, I\\'ve also made the sunny orange cake with orange syrup (which is basically a revani or basbousa, in this case lightened by folding in whipped egg whites), coffee flan, and the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake (see photos above). Maybe it\\'s just my particular slow cooker, but I found that my cakes baked much more quickly than the suggested times, so check at least 30 minutes before the book times to play it safe.<br /><br />***Update 5/26: I have also tried the roasted beets and beet and goat cheese dip, basic recipe for chickpeas and the country chickpea salad and hummus, and next up is the coconut flan (everybody RAVES about the coffee caramel flan, so I wanted to try the variation!). I have enjoyed every dish I\\'ve tried from the Mediterranean Slow Cooker!',\n",

       "  'title': \"Easy, tasty vegetarian dishes from the shelves of Trader Joe's\",\n",
       "  'text': 'My city just got our first Trader Joe\\'s last November, and I\\'ve been looking for easy, tasty ways to use the many intriguing finds I\\'d brought home (masala simmer sauce, mango ginger chutney, spice blends, frozen veggies, etc.). As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see that Cooking with Trader Joe\\'s Cookbook: Vegetarian was coming out.<br /><br />This cookbook is compiled from the other cookbooks in the series, including [[ASIN:0979938481 Cooking With All Things Trader Joe\\'s Cookbook]], [[ASIN:0979938430 Cooking With Trader Joe\\'s Cookbook: Dinner\\'s Done!]] and [[ASIN:0979938465 Cooking With Trader Joe\\'s Cookbook: Lighten Up!]]. You\\'ll see many familiar recipes, particularly from the first Cooking with All Things Trader Joe\\'s cookbook, but this is well worth adding to your collection, particularly for vegetarians as all the recipes are in one place (the one recipe I was looking for but missed was the Perfectly Peared Gorgonzola Quesadillas from [[ASIN:0979938481 Cooking With All Things Trader Joe\\'s Cookbook]], which were absent).<br /><br />The book is a high-quality hardcover, with heavy, glossy pages that stand up well to frequent use.  Chapters are arranged by appetizers, soups and salads, main meals, sides, desserts and drinks, and breakfast. Each recipe features a full-color photo, and you\\'ll also find plenty of whimsical illustrations and photos of ingredients throughout. There are green \"tip\" sidebars with helpful suggestions, and you\\'ll also find useful info in the recipe intros themselves. Each recipe contains detailed nutritional info (calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber, sugar, sodium), prep time, hands-off cooking time, number of servings and serving size, which makes this a great tool for those looking to count calories, fat, sugar, etc. Most of my dozens of vegetarian cookbooks are lacking nutritional info, so I was especially grateful to see it here. Recipes that are (or can be made) gluten-free are marked with a red G (the authors also recently released [[ASIN:1938706021 Cooking With Trader Joe\\'s Cookbook: Gluten-Free]]).<br /><br />I tried several of the recipes over the last few weeks, starting with the olive-stuffed bread, chocolate coffee fudge, lemon-basil cake, and the cheese and chutney mini-rolls. I used TJ\\'s refrigerated herb pizza dough and their black olive tapenade for the olive bread, and the resulting loaf had a fabulous flavor and texture. The next time I make it, I would consider making individual rolls; it would be a little less messy for serving a crowd (and you could freeze the rolls and reheat them one at a time).<br /><br />The cheese and chutney mini-rolls made a great appetizer! The recipe recommends using aged sharp cheddar or cave-aged gruyere, but my new favorite find at TJ\\'s is the Cinnamon Toscano, which marries beautifully with the mango and ginger in the chutney. This would also be good served as an open-faced sandwich / crostini, if a little messy!<br /><br />The chocolate coffee fudge was a great twist on a classic recipe; the boost of espresso really enhanced the chocolate, and the fudge stayed fresh and creamy in an airtight container for several days.<br /><br />The lemon-basil cake was a revelation; despite containing ½ cup of finely chopped basil (time to break out those chiffonade skills), the basil adds a subtle complement to the lemon zest. The one addition I made was brushing on a lemon syrup made from 1/3 cup water and ¼ cup sugar brought to a boil, then add the juice of two lemons off the heat and let cool. This way, you end up using all of the lemons; the recipe calls for the zest of two lemons, and if you make the lemon syrup/glaze, there\\'s no waste (plus, the syrup helps the cake to stay moist). The next time I make this, I\\'m going to bake it in my [[ASIN:B0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf]] for added visual appeal! This would be perfect as a teatime or brunch offering.<br /><br />All of the recipes I tried were tasty and came together quickly. I\\'ve bookmarked several others that I want to try in the near future, including the Indian spinach pizza, quiche, balsamic roasted fennel, anytime Mediterranean pasta (the ultimate pantry staple dinner!), and pasta alla checca.<br /><br />Cooking With Trader Joe\\'s Cookbook: Vegetarian is a cookbook I\\'ll find myself coming back to frequently for its combination of interesting recipes (lots of international influences from India, Asia, Mexico, Italy, etc.), quick prep times, nutritional info, and most importantly, tasty results!<br /><br />(A huge thank you to authors Deana Gunn and Wona Minati for the autographed review copy!)',\n",

       "  'text': \"I first heard of Robin Robertson from her yuba-wrapped vegetarian haggis in [[ASIN:1558322566 Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker: 200 Recipes for Healthy and Hearty One-Pot Meals That Are Ready When You Are]]. Now Robin has released a slow-cooker book catering to vegans, but you certainly don't have to be vegan (or even vegetarian!) to enjoy it. You'll find many surprising and tasty international influences within, like Vietnamese pho, three-bean cholent, Moroccan tempeh and chickpeas with prunes and apricots, French cassoulets, Greek beans, Latin updates (chimichurri spaghetti squash, layered tamale pie, seitan ropa vieja) and even a touch of soul food.<br /><br />If you're new to slow cookers, you'll find a handy chapter on slow cooker basics, including crockery care caveats (say that three times fast!), slow cooker points and pointers, tips for slow-cooking success, timing factors, and an in-depth look at ingredients (beans, packaged meat alternatives, vegan thickeners, etc.). Recipes are labeled whether there is a gluten- and/or soy-free option; however, no nutritional info is provided.<br /><br />Like her previous slow-cooker book (and those by other authors like Michele Scicolone), you will find many recipes that recommend sauteeing veggies and/or spices in a skillet before adding them to the slow cooker. Yes, this results in extra pots and pans and prep time, but it adds a whole other layer of flavor to the finished dish.<br /><br />I tried several dishes, including the layered tapenade potatoes, slow-cooker pho, and the pi&ntilde;a colada cake (which I baked up in muffin tins instead of cake form).<br /><br />*The layered tapenade potatoes had a great depth of flavor from the combination of the olives (I used kalamata instead of green), sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and capers; this would be good on its own as a dip. I like lots of crunchy topping, so I added extra toasted panko (the recipe only calls for 3 tablespoons).<br /><br />* The pho had a rich, spicy broth made with whole star anise and cloves (I used [[ASIN:B0006SYA3E Bouquet Garni Bags]] for easier removal). I also used a different kind of miso that I had on hand. This would make a great breakfast soup on its own without the rice noodles, much like miso is served in Japan.<br /><br />*Finally, I tried the pi&ntilde;a colada cake, which is rich with three types of coconut (shredded unsweetened, coconut extract, and cream of coconut), a splash of dark rum, and pineapple chunks and juice. These baked up super-moist, and I added additional shredded coconut after applying the glaze.<br /><br />One thing to note: the bean recipes call for precooked beans, either canned or homemade, so make sure you have some form of cooked beans on hand before starting the recipes. One of the few recipes that calls for dried beans is the three-bean cholent, which has a recommended cooking time of 8 to 11.5 hours or overnight.<br /><br />I've already bookmarked many other recipes to try (the ribollita is next on my list). I particularly liked the breakfast and dessert chapters, which feature cakes, bread pudding, and breads. The hot sangria from the hot drinks chapter will also be in frequent rotation, and you'll find plenty of appetizing nibbles to serve with the various punches (spiced rum punch, celebration punch, blushing spiced cider). There is sufficient variety and dishes to suit every taste to keep you happily coming back to Fresh from the Vegan Slow Cooker.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Our first Trader Joe\\'s recently opened, so I am thrilled to be able to review \"The I Love Trader Joe\\'s Vegetarian Cookbook!\"  I\\'ve long been a fan of Trader Joe\\'s pantry staples, particularly their rice and grain blends, and was looking for new ways to put these pantry staples to use in my kitchen.  (If you don\\'t live close to a Trader Joe\\'s, most of the ingredients can be substituted with whatever is available in your neck of the woods.)<br /><br />Beginning with breakfast, you\\'ll find lots of quick and easy ideas that you can easily put together in half an hour or less, including orange blueberry cornbread muffins, pineapple upside-down pancakes, quick and dirty Danish, spiced apricot farina, and waffles.<br /><br />You\\'ll also find all sorts of global influences, including Greek (Greek chickpea-laf), Italian (herbed polenta fries, white bean basil spread, Olive my love pasta), Asian (stir fries, gomasio, tofu), Latin (Mexi-bake casserole, tempeh tacos) Midwestern (hot dishes and casseroles) and Middle Eastern, as well as upscale nibbles (heavenly sweet n\\' savory bites rich with caramelized onions, figs, and blue cheese, or the figgy blue sandwich). Old-fashioned comfort food like grown-up grilled cheese and fancy macaroni bake find their way in too.<br /><br />For sweet endings, you\\'ll find gluten-free brownies, cakes, kheer (Indian rice pudding made with coconut milk, dried fruit and nuts), amazing everything cookies (featuring nuts, chocolate chips, peanut butter, and banana chips), fall-inspired dishes like gingered bread pudding  and fall pumpkin spice cobbler,  and cheesecake (regular and vegan versions).<br /><br />I tried the herbed polenta fries and the Greek chickpea-laf first. I ended up doubling the topping for the polenta fries, and would also strongly recommend blotting the polenta slices before adding the topping; otherwise, they tend not to get as crisp due to the high moisture content. They were delicious with the suggested lemon aioli (vegan), and as good as (or better than) most French fries I\\'ve had.<br /><br />The Greek chickpea-laf is made with Trader Joe\\'s Harvest Grains blend, garbanzos (I used cannellini beans, since it was what I had on hand), lemon juice and oregano (the author is quite liberal with dried oregano; both the polenta fries and the pilaf called for 2 tablespoons each!), with tomatoes, parsley and feta cheese folded in. This would be a great dish for a potluck or picnic; the contrasts in textures and flavors (tart lemon and feta, sweet tomatoes, soft Israeli couscous) was unexpected and delicious.<br /><br />Recipes are conveniently labeled as vegetarian, vegan (or include instructions on how to make a recipe vegan), and gluten-free when applicable. Also included are sample menus and conversions, however, nutritional info is not provided. For those who need photos to accompany their recipes, there are lots of gorgeous full-color photos for nearly every recipe. One small gripe: the Index only contains recipe names, not recipes by ingredient, so if you\\'re trying to quickly locate, say, a potato dish, you\\'ll have to flip through until you locate one.<br /><br />Overall, \" The I Love Trader Joe\\'s Vegetarian Cookbook\" is a great addition to your cookbook collection if you\\'re looking for fast, flavorful recipes that come together  quickly.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Ulysses Press)',\n",

The first of two volumes (the second being [[ASIN:0471359262 The Advanced Professional Pastry Chef]]), this gorgeous (and hefty) tome walks the novice pastry chef through glazes, meringues, basic doughs (short dough, puff pastry, pate a choux, pasta), yeast breads, breakfast breads and pastries, quick breads / pound cakes, sponge cakes, decorated cakes, individual pastries, ice cream, and custard-type desserts. The section on plated desserts is worth the price of the book alone, as you\\'ll find templates for pastry cutouts, piping instructions, etc.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is NOT a book for the average home baker. In most cases, the yields (and quantities, which are given in weights, not volume) are geared towards restaurants  / foodservice, although certain bread recipes are scaled down for smaller yields, such as the small-batch Black Forest bread with cocoa and dried cherries, challah, and Southwestern corn and cheese bread.<br /><br />The included line drawings are enormously helpful to illustrate techniques. The Chef\\'s Tips and sidebars further explain techniques or recipe-specific advice. Several in-depth charts like cookie recipes categorized by texture, production method, and storage capability provide an at-a-glance guide to what would be an otherwise overwhelming number of recipes to juggle.<br /><br />The book particularly excels in its treatment of European (French/Italian/Viennese) pastries. Even the ice cream chapter yields unique flavor surprises, like the macadamia nut ice cream, banana-poppy seed ice cream, and avocado-mango ice cream. You\\'ll find unusual frozen yogurts as well, like black-pepper honey, gingered pineapple, and strawberry-rhubarb frozen yogurt with ginger, that provide a welcome change.<br /><br />The comprehensive appendices cover nearly 150 pages alone, including an extremely thorough glossary of ingredients and tools, precise metric conversions and metric equivalents, metric/US length, weight, and volume equivalents,  and a particularly helpful section on yields, baker\\'s percentages, and Baumé / Brix scale readings.<br /><br />Despite owning several dozen baking books, I find myself coming back time and again to \"The Professional Pastry Chef\" for its clear instructions, charts, and fascinating food science tidbits. Chef Bo makes for a most pleasant and patient instructor, and his thorough explanations of techniques and ingredients will serve you well whether you\\'re an advanced home baker or an experienced pastry chef.<br /><br />(Many thanks to Wiley for the review copy)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I discovered Debbie Macomber through her [[ASIN:0373892136 Debbie Macomber\\'s Cedar Cove Cookbook]], which was in our small local library in Central Japan. After returning home from six months with no kitchen (and having spent the previous Christmas overseas), I was thrilled to see her Christmas cookbook, and made numerous dishes from it for my first Christmas back home with family and friends, including the three-cheese scalloped potatoes and numerous sweets (triple ginger chocolate chunk cookies, almond joy to the world, cappuccino snickerdoodles with mocha glaze). The only real miss was the scalloped potatoes, which turned out far too watery. The recipe calls for 3 cups whole milk but no flour or other thickener, and the starch from the potatoes wasn\\'t enough to hold it together (the milk is simply heated before being poured over the potatoes and baked).<br /><br />The recipes include traditional favorites alongside international additions like Spanish tortilla, green pea hummus, Provencal tomatoes, and tzatziki dip, so you can mix and match influences if you so desire. Tucked between the recipes you\\'ll find cute, easy decorating ideas and crafts. If you could wrap up the sights, smells, and tastes of everything wonderful about holiday season, it would look a lot like this! \"Debbie Macomber\\'s Christmas\" would make a wonderful gift for family and friends, and it\\'s also a great cookbook to cook from together as a family (some of the simpler recipes would be appropriate for young kitchen helpers).',\n",

Those updates start in the first chapter, with a pepper jack pastry crust, lemon and lavender short crust pastry, and a cream cheese pastry crust. You'll find new takes on cream, custard, and chiffon pies such as pomegranate cream cheese, cantaloupe cream, orange and dark chocolate cheese, roasted Hatch chilies, apple, and ricotta hand pies, and savory pies such as an apple, brie and bacon tart, lobster pie, and a French-inspired duck confit tart.<br /><br />Unexpected flavor elements like green tea, saffron, rose and wasabi turn up and add a flavor boost. For the more adventurous, you'll find ancho chile, pecan and chocolate toffee pie, habanero passion fruit pie, and strawberry jalapeno pie (many of the exotic pies in particular have a marked Latin influence).<br /><br />The book is surprisingly compact, yet each of its 150 recipes is clearly laid out with a smattering of photos throughout. The font could stand to be a bit larger, and I found the recipe prefaces in blue font to be a bit hard to read from a distance, but overall the layout is pleasing and easy to use.<br /><br />Beginning bakers may find the introduction too perfunctory to effectively coach; there are no illustrations and no glossary / guide to recommended equipment, but if you are already comfortable with the basics of making a pie crust and pie from scratch, you'll find much to enjoy in Not-So-Humble Pies if you're willing to experiment with new flavors and accents.\",\n",

Unlike Frommer's Day-by-Day France guide, the Frommer's Paris 2012 guide is clearly laid out in an uncluttered, easy-to-read format that will make planning your next trip to the City of Light a breeze. From the handy list of maps to its handy suggested itineraries (the most unforgettable travel experiences, the best local neighborhoods, the best neighborhoods for getting lost, etc.), you can quickly make a list of your top destinations and get an idea of location, price, and opening hours at a glance. There are detailed walking tours for the various neighborhoods, great maps, and many sidebars giving additional info on monuments, locations, etc. You'll find a detailed guide to shopping in Paris, including the expected fashion and parfum shops as well as housewares, crystal, souvenirs, and stationary.<br /><br />There are also numerous lodging suggestions by location and price point, and suggested day trips out of Paris that include options many other books gloss over (the prerequisite Versailles, Chartres, Disneyland Paris and Giverny, as well as Auvers-sur-Oise, Fontainbleau, and Vaux Le Vicomte). The transportation section is also quite good, giving a solid overview of the metro/RER trains, on foot, bicycle and boat. There's a very servicable guide to French phrases, a pull-out map, and a great metro guide inside the back cover. Of particular interest for families traveling with young children, you'll find many suggestions for kid-friendly dining and museum experiences.<br /><br />This is a great (and compact!) guide to the City of Light, and I highly recommend it for planning your trip to Paris and environs.\",\n",

       "  'title': \"It's easy cooking greens (apologies to Kermit :-)\",\n",
       "  'text': 'One of my favorite things to buy every week is organic kale and mustard greens, but other than my standby recipe for kale chips or using it in soups, I wasn\\'t really sure how to show it off to its best advantage. Enter Nava Atlas\\'s \"Wild About Greens,\" which will give you 125 vegan recipes for kale, collards, mustard greens, and more.<br /><br />The journey begins with a brief guide to preparation and an illustrated who\\'s who of greens, from common varieties (spinach, kale, chard), to those I\\'d looked at but didn\\'t know how to prepare (including  Asian greens such as tatsoi and mizuna, beet greens, dandelion greens, turnip and radish greens). Thanks to Nava, I learned that you can freeze greens by blanching them and putting them into freezer bags (before, I had the bad habit of leaving them in the fridge until the end of the week when they were past their prime).<br /><br />Chapter 1 appropriately starts with basic preparations, including sautés, braising, and stir-fries. I particularly enjoyed the Mediterranean greens with pine nuts and raisins and the chard with raisins and pecans from this chapter. Subsequent chapters focus on heartier combinations of greens and grains and/or beans, including pasta with two beans and escarole, rosemary potatoes and collard greens with vegan sausage, and ragout of broccoli rabe with white beans and porcini mushrooms.<br /><br />I was first introduced to massaged kale salads in Nava\\'s [[ASIN:1402780052 Vegan Holiday Kitchen: More than 200 Delicious, Festive Recipes for Special Occasions]] so I was happy to see a wider variety here, including kale salad with fresh fruit and radicchio and Asian-flavored kale and napa cabbage salad. You\\'ll find a large variety of soups utilizing greens, including the wonderful Italian-style potato and escarole soup (I added sun-dried tomatoes that I had on hand, and it really added an extra layer of texture and flavor). Finally, the recipes are rounded out by a juicing primer and such unusual flavors as beets and greens juice with apples and ginger, sparkling spinach juice, and several greens-based smoothies: spinach and mango smoothie, nutty chocolate-banana and spinach smoothie, and kale and pear smoothie.<br /><br />One small note: the text color on some of the sections is very light and there is little contrast against the background, making these recipes difficult to read from a distance. Also, there are relatively few photos if you\\'re one of those who likes to see photos for each recipe. And finally, no nutritional info is given, which would have been appreciated.<br /><br />Verdict: \"Wild About Greens\" is a great way to make the most of bountiful seasonal/regional greens and is sure to expand your recipe repertoire. There\\'s enough variety that you can easily cook through several weeks of recipes without a repeat, and you\\'ll find various international influences (Italian, Asian, Mexican) to boot. This is a great primer for CSA members or anyone looking to eat more healthfully.<br /><br />(Thanks to Nava Atlas for the review copy!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'My first introduction to Nava Atlas was when a friend gave me a copy of [[ASIN:0963024353 Vegetariana: A Rich Harvest of Wit, Lore, and Recipes]] several years ago. While I was browsing at a local bookstore recently, I ran across Vegan Holiday Kitchen and was drawn in by the gorgeous photos and recipes; I was particularly intrigued by the Jewish vegan updates of beloved classics like sweet noodle kugel, tzimmes, matzoh balls and challah.<br /><br />Nava was kind enough to send a review copy, and I promptly singled out four test recipes: massaged kale salad, skinny figgy bars, citrus-roasted tofu, and the chocolate orange cake. The kale salad was delicious and easily modified; I\\'ve been making it with mustard greens and candied ginger since it lends itself to experimentation with other dried fruits, greens, and seeds / nuts. It takes only moments to throw together, and is a perfect last-minute side dish for a potluck or party.<br /><br />The skinny figgy bars are a guilt-free update on Fig Newtons; a paste of figs and dates is perked up by a touch of lemon juice, cinnamon and ginger; the filling would make a great jam or spread on its own (I soaked the dates in hot water to soften them before adding them to the food processor). The quick-oat crust almost seemed too wet upon mixing, but baked up tender and moist. I also made the optional orange drizzle, which gave the bars an additional boost of citrus that complemented the lemon juice in the filling.<br /><br />For the citrus-roasted tofu, I used Italian bitter orange marmalade, which is then mixed with dry mustard, soy sauce, and pepper.  I left out the carrot and almond garnish, as well as the tarragon and curry powder, since I wanted the flavor focus to be on the citrus. One caveat: I didn\\'t leave enough space between the slices of tofu while baking, so the edges didn\\'t get as crispy as I would have liked. The final flavor was great, though, and I will definitely make this again using a larger roasting pan and would consider making 1.5 times the marinade, since much of it bakes off in the oven, and you\\'re supposed to use the extra marinade to spoon over before serving.<br /><br />Finally, the chocolate orange cake seemed to be a very thick batter (half whole wheat, half unbleached flour) that seemed to be a bit dense when it baked up, but the orange zest and juice made for a very moist, flavorful cake; it\\'s difficult to believe that it\\'s fat-free. There\\'s even an unexpected touch of balsamic vinegar (I used some of my prized 18-year balsamic from Fustini\\'s, which has an incredible depth). Rarely have I had a recipe turn out like the included photo, but the chocolate-orange cake looked runway-ready and was quickly devoured by an appreciative audience.<br /><br />The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out in an easy-to-read font, and there are plenty of gorgeous full-color photos throughout. I loved that the recipe titles were color-coded to correspond with the section they were in (Passover titles were in blue, Easter recipes in purple, etc.). I loved that the dishes arranged by season, so you can easily make use of the freshest seasonal produce. All of the recipes I tried turned out as described without requiring any tweaking, and I would definitely make them again. There\\'s a huge wealth of influences; you\\'ll find Middle Eastern-inspired dips and spreads, Mexican and Asian flavors, Eastern European and Jewish comfort food, and Native American influences for Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Two small things that could have improved the book for me would have been nutritional info and an easier-to-use index; the index font is about half the size of the recipes, and it\\'s difficult to quickly locate a given ingredient or recipe since they\\'re lumped together in paragraph form, but overall \"Vegan Holiday Kitchen\" is a wonderful addition to anyone\\'s cookbook library.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Nava Atlas/ Sterling)',\n",

       "  'text': \"I had the pleasure of working in Japan for six months last year, and traveled quite frequently on the weekends, including Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Hiroshima, Itsukushima, Takayama, and Toba. Like with any guidebook, it's impossible to fit *every* attraction, historical site, restaurant, etc. into a single volume, but Frommer's Japan Day by Day does a decent job at covering the main points (castles, museums, hot springs, temples and shrines), along with sample itineraries depending on how much time you have available. You'll find the mandatory blurbs on manga, anime, and pop culture (maid cafes, Studio Ghibli museum, etc.), but also some unique additions like Japanese ghost and monster myths. There's also a brief, two-page overview of the damage caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the book kicks off with Tokyo and Mount Fuji. You'll find the prerequisite mention of the ninja museum, along with cormorant fishing on the Kiso River (I didn't get to witness this firsthand, unfortunately!). I lived quite close to Nagoya, and their suggested sites are quite good (Nagoya Castle, Tokugawa art museum and gardens, Noritake Garden, Nagoya Aquarium, Atsuta Jingu). Frommer's seemed to focus on smaller cities that I didn't see listed in the other guidebooks I used around Japan ([[ASIN:0307480496 Fodor's Japan (Full-color Travel Guide)]], [[ASIN:1848366159 The Rough Guide to Japan (Rough Guide Japan)]]). Some of their restaurant suggestions were interesting (falafel and Italian in the ancient capital of Nara, for example). I would have liked to see more space devoted to Kyoto, but each city generally only gets two or three pages of suggested sites with the exception of Tokyo and Osaka. Also, the editing could have been improved; the numerous sidebars and inserts frequently broke up text and made the book feel disjointed and cluttered.<br /><br />The most glaring omission, as other reviewers have mentioned, was that of Takayama in the Japan Alps. It's included on all the maps, but nary a mention of Gero (a famous spa town), Takayama (famous for its sake breweries and traditional wooden townhouses), or Shirakawa-go (famous for its towering thatched-roof farmhouses). It's too bad, since Takayama in particular has an astounding collection of Art Nouveau glassware by Tiffany, Daum, Galle, etc. and Art Nouveau furniture.<br /><br />From my own experiences traveling around Japan, I preferred [[ASIN:0307480496 Fodor's Japan (Full-color Travel Guide)]] for its background on important sites and [[ASIN:1848366159 The Rough Guide to Japan (Rough Guide Japan)]] for its off-the-beaten path suggestions and activities (I located several great cooking classes and activities this way); Japan Day by Day is serviceable, but it felt too cluttered and difficult to navigate for quickly locating a city and its sights.\",\n",

Titles like \"From the Kitchen\" and [[ASIN:1906868654 Sweet Home: Over 100 Heritage Desserts and Ideas for Preserving Family Recipes]] take this trend one step further by combining cookbooks with genealogy by giving the reader hints and tips on how to interview family members and preserve treasured family recipes.<br /><br />Two-thirds of \"From the Family Kitchen\" is devoted to discussing and showcasing the evolution of American cuisine, from its early origins to post-war inventions that have shaped our food today. You\\'ll find discussions on pioneers, how immigrants shaped American food, and how wartime rationing changed the way we cooked. Each chapter contains a fairly comprehensive bibliography. There are sample menus and quotes from vintage cookbooks, along with a large section devoted to community cookbooks. The discussion of collecting and preserving family recipes doesn\\'t begin until page 80, with several lists of interview questions related to family history, kitchens, meals, etc. and advice on recording interviews from old-school tape recorders to Skype recordings. Other online resources such as Google Books,  manuscript collections, online auctions, and the Periodical Source Index are discussed.<br /><br />In Part Two, historical recipes are examined, including some crucial info on early cooking terms (many derived from French), measurements (including archaic ones like gills, wine glasses, and saucers), weights and measures, and cooking times and temperatures. Many very early cookbooks left out important steps, assuming that cooks of the day would instinctively know what to do. As for the historical recipes themselves, there\\'s a little of everything, from Mountain Dew pudding to organ meats (sweetbread salad, fried brains, kidney stew), assorted sides (including the quirkily-named rinktum diddy), and cakes and puddings (sadly, none of these immediately piqued my interest, but to each his own). The final third of the book is an illustrated recipe journal, with each entry listing the recipe name, ingredients, directions, and memories of the recipe with space to post a photo of the dish or chef. At the back is a rather complete bibliography and list of resources.<br /><br />\"From the Family Kitchen\" is a fascinating read into early American food and dining habits, but its format makes it a bit awkward to cook from for the heirloom recipes (the font is on the small side, and the recipes are printed right on top of each other in paragraph format), and I found the included space for writing down recipes to be a bit cramped (perhaps it was the illustrations, which extend a good 1\" into the page on either side). The historical framing is fascinating, but I don\\'t know that it would have much reread value for me.<br /><br />However, this would be a good starting point for those looking to capture family recipes and cooking memories; there are some useful interview questions for those who wish to build a family cookbook.  I also highly recommend Shutterfly\\'s cookbook templates, where you can easily create professional-looking photo cookbooks using your digital photos and typing recipes; these make great family heirlooms or gifts.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I wasn\\'t familiar with Michael Natkin before receiving Herbivoracious in a recent Vine newsletter, but I\\'m definitely a convert! Herbivoracious is taken from Michael\\'s blog of the same name. His passion for great food has led him on several internships and positions in various kitchens.  A vegetarian since the age of eighteen, he\\'s picked up a lot of great global influences along the way. Herbivoracious is full of nods to Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Mediterranean, Latin American and Middle Eastern vegetarian cuisine. You won\\'t find any processed soy \"meat\" products or vegan cheeze. Instead, the full flavors of seasonal fruits and veggies are left to shine. In addition to all the vegetarian recipes, there is a selection of vegan and gluten-free choices as well. And did I mention how amazing the food is?<br /><br />I tried four recipes from Herbivoracious: the baked penne with mushrooms and fontina, spicy tamarind-glazed potatoes, spectacular chocolate-espresso brownies, and the rosemary-blueberry sauce, which I used over Greek yogurt in the mornings. The baked penne packs a wallop of flavor; it\\'s full of meaty seared mushrooms with a sprinkling of oregano, red pepper flakes, and sweet vermouth (I substituted marsala, since that\\'s what I had on hand). The blanched baby spinach was incredibly flavorful, and the cubes of fontina melted throughout and added another dimension of flavor. This may be my new favorite pasta recipe ever.<br /><br />The spicy tamarind-glazed potatoes (use less peppers if you want less heat!) combined creamy baby potatoes in a sweet-spicy sauce. The spectacular chocolate-espresso brownies were modeled in part on Ina Garten\\'s take on [[ASIN:0688002900 The Soho Charcuterie Cookbook: Fabulous Food for Entertaining]]; they were good, but they still didn\\'t beat my all-time gold standard of the Baked brownie from [[ASIN:1584797215 Baked: New Frontiers in Baking]]. The rosemary-blueberry sauce was an unexpected flavor profile that would be superb on cheesecake, crepes, or over yogurt (or ice cream!). The Sauces, Condiments, and Basic Recipes section has some fantastic bases (tomato jam with rosemary and saffron, lemon-mustard vinaigrette, Japanese sesame salt, quick harissa oil) that you\\'ll find yourself coming back to again and again.<br /><br />There\\'s a beautifully compact intro on ingredients and equipment. Along the way, there are plenty of interesting sidebars, tips, suggested menus, making the most of seasonal produce, and more. You\\'ll find familiar favorites like mac and cheese (here it\\'s bolstered by smoked paprika and smoked cheese) rubbing elbows with kimchi stew, Sephardic fried leek fritters, and rice vermicelli with ginger-grapefruit sauce.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book that really appealed to me with its global flavor profiles, ease of preparation, and commonplace supermarket ingredients. It\\'s not pretentious like some celebrity chef vegetarian cookbooks. It\\'s great for weeknights or for throwing together a salad or other potluck offering at a moment\\'s notice due to the short prep time required of many recipes. This would be a great first cookbook for someone new to a vegetarian diet, or anyone looking for delicious meat-free meal ideas.',\n",

Geared at a K-12 audience, there\\'s still plenty of great tips, ideas, and checklists that can be adapted to any classroom environment with a few modifications.<br /><br />Doug has been involved with ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education), and is a patient teacher here. The chapters are down-to-earth and fun without being condescending towards beginners (in my organization, many of our instructors are older and not familiar / comfortable with the latest and greatest tech toys). There are several really great checklists to help you evaluate where your school / district currently stands in terms of ed tech infrastructure, training, and more. Doug starts out by looking at basics: computers (OS, format, peripherals), software (freeware, open source), and cloud computing, as well as what a technologically well-equipped classroom should look like. Along the way, survival tip sidebars offer additional hints and resources. I loved Doug\\'s \"Seven Stupid Mistakes Teachers Make with Technology\" and \"Seven Brilliant Things Teachers Do with Technology\"; I used a modified version in a recent ed tech symposium to highlight the inherent dangers (as well as the possibilities) posed by our social media age.<br /><br />You\\'ll find handy guides to the best way to reach your audience (blog w/ RSS feed, Facebook fan pages, blasts), curriculum and course management systems, assessing technology-enhanced student work, IT skill evaluations broken down by age group, teaching 21st-century skills, managing disruptive technologies in the classroom, and practices for safe and ethical technology use. There are also tips and checklists aimed at ed tech trainers like myself, and a great chapter on developing a long-term learning strategy.<br /><br />I recommended that my organization purchase additional copies of this as a valuable reference for our faculty, many of whom are older and not comfortable / familiar with the educational technology upgrades that have appeared in our classrooms. Each section is clearly laid out in easy-to-understand descriptions (no overly technical lingo or CALL research studies tossed in to muddy the waters), and I\\'ve found myself coming back to this book numerous times to see how Doug describes a particular technology or process in the hopes it will better connect me with my audience. If you\\'re a classroom teacher, ed tech / SMART Trainer, or ed tech coordinator, this is a must-have for your library.',\n",

       "  'text': 'For years I used my old reliable Rival Crockpot with pretty consistent results.  Yes, it was easy to use.  Yes, it was nice to have a hot meal when I got home from work.  Eventually I stopped using it because the food was predictable and the presentation (important to me) was less than desirable.  Recently I purchased a basic slow cooker to replace the previous one which died, possibly from boredom.  I was overjoyed to see \"The French Slow Cooker\" by Michele Scicolone.  This cookbook author has taken ordinary ingredients and combined them in new, flavorful  ways.  My  attempt at \"Sunday Roast Chicken with Potatoes, Lemon, and Thyme\" was a success and enjoyed by all.  I religiously followed the recipe until I was directed to squeeze the lemon halves into the juices.  I found the juices to be tart enough so thickened the mixture without the additional lemon juice called out in the recipe.  The chicken was flavorful and moist and the thick potato slices kept their shape.<br /> I have bookmarked several  other \"must try\" recipes from this collection and am looking forward to enjoying the French flair these recipes provide.  The recipes are not complicated so they should not intimidate the average cook.  The Tips and Techniques at the beginning of the cookbook should be a great help to the novice cook.

       "  'title': 'A sweet taste of a vanishing world...',\n",
       "  'text': '\"Inside the Jewish Bakery,\" written by two Jewish veteran bakers, lovingly captures a tantalizing slice of the vanished world of the heyday of Jewish bakeries in the United States. Sprinkled throughout are vintage black-and-white photos from Eastern Europe and 20th century Jewish bakeries in New York. The first section is appropriately titled \"Vanished Worlds,\" and briefly traces the history of Yiddish culture in Europe, setting the stage for the in-depth discussion of Yiddish baked goods to come (please note that the book focuses only on Ashkenazi breads and baked goods; if you\\'re looking for Sephardic recipes, I highly recommend the Spanish-language [[ASIN:8427032374 Dulce lo vivas/ Live Sweet: La Reposteria Sefardi/ the Sefardi Bakery (Spanish Edition)]] or [[ASIN:0684870037 The World Of Jewish Desserts: More Than 400 Delectable Recipes from Jewish Communities]]).<br /><br />The first bread mentioned is perhaps the most symbolic: challah, that golden egg-enriched braided loaf served on Shabbat.  There are five challah recipes in addition to a step-by-step photo guide to challah shapes and braids. \"Jewish rye,\" or at least the mass-produced variety that most of us grew up on, bears little resemblance to the rye that was baked and eaten in Eastern European shtetls (\"If challah was the queen of the Shabbes table, rye was the poor but honest yeoman who served during the other six days of the week\"). The \"new\" rye breads made in the US featured finely milled rye flour and up to 80 percent wheat flour, whereas their Old Country cousins were about 55 percent rye flour for gebatlt broyt and about 95 percent rye flour for razeve broyt. \"Inside the Jewish Bakery\" offers several variants, starting with a rye sour culture, black bread, rustic pumpernickel, corn rye (kornbroyt), old-school Jewish Deli rye and mild deli rye. You\\'ll also find potato bread, Vienna bread, bagels, pletsl, Kaiser rolls, and bialys.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the pastry offerings, as my Polish grandmother would frequently make yeast coffeecakes, poppy seed rolls, and other Old World desserts that were a pleasant counterpoint to the sickly-sweet supermarket confections that my classmates would bring for birthdays. The book truly shines in its description of the various short doughs, laminated doughs, and fillings, and there is an excellent \"Pastry Quick Reference Chart\" that\\'s worth the price of the book if you\\'re a frequent pastry baker. There are plenty of step-by-step illustrations and photos of techniques along the way, and a centerfold of color photographs submitted by what I assume are the book\\'s test bakers.<br /><br />You\\'ll find strudel, Danishes, bear claws, babka, yeast doughnuts, honey cake, sour cream coffee cake, and cheesecakes, along with a handy troubleshooting guide. Also included are old-fashioned comfort food cookies like rugelach, tayglech, mohn bars and kichelach. I tried the poppy seed cookies, which reminded me of the poppy seed rolls my grandmother used to make. The filling recipe was easy yet vastly superior to the usual Solo canned filling that my grandmother (and I) used, and I chose the sour cream short dough for the base, resulting in a tender, flaky pastry with a sweet, crunchy layer of poppy seeds and strudel. Patience is a virtue with many of these recipes, since the dough requires ample chilling time before use, but the wait is well worth it. The results were as delicious as any my babcia used to make, and a refreshing taste of a vanishing world.<br /><br />Measurements are given in volume, ounces and pounds, metric, and baker\\'s percentages. At this point in time, I\\'m only giving the book four instead of five stars due to the numerous errata, many of which affect the bread dough recipes (at last count, there were six full pages of errata available as a PDF on the authors\\' website; see my comment below for the link), so be sure to print off the list and double-check before starting your recipe. Hopefully these errors will be corrected in a second edition. \"Inside the Jewish Bakery\" is obviously a labor of love, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in baking and pastry making, especially if you are interested in Yiddish culture.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Trina Kaye)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Good, but didn\\'t hold up as well as \"Jessica\\'s Guide to Dating on the Dark Side\"',\n",
       "  'text': '\"Jessica Rules the Dark Side\" picks up where [[ASIN:0547259409 Jessica\\'s Guide to Dating on the Dark Side]] left off (sort of). In the interim between the two novels, author Beth Fantaskey posted online chapters detailing the preparations for Jessica\\'s wedding to Lucius in Romania. Sadly, much of the romantic spark between Lucius and Jessica is absent in the sequel. Jessica is having difficulties adapting to her role as a vampire princess; she struggles with learning Romanian, can\\'t communicate with the kitchen staff, and her parents are conveniently abroad in South America. A high-profile murder in the castle casts suspicion on Lucius, and Jessica is forced to take over in his absence. There are several narrators here in addition to Jessica and Lucius, so the POV switches rather frequently (sometimes jarringly).<br /><br />The original novel was snappy, witty, and engaging. Sadly, this is absent here. Jessica is almost a secondary character; instead, it\\'s Mindy\\'s turn to shine. Mindy\\'s summer fling with Raniero (Lucius\\'s cousin) has her moping her way through most of the book. Raniero makes a poor stand-in for Lucius, although we learn that his history is just as violent, if not more so. His pacifist Buddhist surfer-boy facade is just that, and when he lets it slip, it proves to have terrifying consequences. Granted, Mindy and Raniero do have chemistry, and they provide some comic relief, but the emphasis should have been on Jessica (the title *is* \"Jessica Rules the Dark Side,\" after all...). Instead, she engages in Bella-esque moping (see: [[ASIN:0316075655 New Moon (The Twilight Saga)]]) for much of the novel, feeling sorry for herself and her situation. She fears she\\'s going crazy as she begins to have vivid hallucinations. By the time she finally gets her act together, it\\'s pretty much the end of the book.<br /><br />My biggest issue with \"Jessica Rules the Dark Side\" was that I\\'d figured out the mystery (if not the villain(s), almost immediately, so it was frustrating to see several characters struggling with adding up two and two. And the missing \"chapters\" in preparation for Jessica\\'s wedding add some insight; it would have been nice if they had been included, or at least the major points, as you feel like you\\'re being dropped into the middle if you haven\\'t read the chapters online.',\n",

       "  'text': \"When I first saw [[ASIN:1558327495 The Bonne Femme Cookbook: Simple, Splendid Food That French Women Cook Every Day]] in my Vine newsletter, I was thinking it was somehow related to [[ASIN:0375710515 French Women Don't Get Fat]] (it's not). Much to my pleasant surprise, this charming cookbook is filled with the (simplified) pleasures of dining French-style, including a proper start with jaunty apéritifs and amuse-bouches like flaky green olive and cheese spirals, chutney-ham amuse-bouches, cognac julep, kir, and lemony pear sparkling sangria (there's even a handy guide to setting up your own apéritif dinatoîre). The recipes are a delightful blend of French and international influences, like the North African staples tabbouleh and couscous, or a Spanish-influenced salad with paprika, sherry vinegar, and Cabrales cheese, and many Italian-influenced dishes, like the amazing tagliatelle with blue cheese, walnuts and grapes.<br /><br />Along the way, sidebars contain stories about various aspects of French culture and cuisine from the author's experience as an exchange student and frequent visitor. Each recipe has a complete introduction as well that gives insight into its presentation (there are very useful tips for ordering in French restaurants, like the cheese trolley and dessert tray (hint: no, all those desserts are NOT for you!) and origins. The best part is that most recipes come together fairly quickly using common U.S. supermarket ingredients whenever possible. Sparse but charming illustrations round out the book (sorry, food photo lovers; there are no photographs of completed dishes in this volume!).<br /><br />I love that the recipes are low-maintenance. Consider the Zenlike simplicity of Any-Night Baked Rice: you saute garlic, add the rice to coat with butter, add stock, cover the pot and throw it into the oven for 15 minutes. The blending of classic French flavors is refreshing without being heavy, and captures the various regions of France, like the fingerling potatoes with walnuts and thyme from Périgord. Vegetarians will be pleased with the wide variety of grain-based and vegetable dishes that are complete meals in themselves. The best part is that these recipes can be completed in an hour or less in most cases. And the dishes are perfectly elegant: roast chicken breasts with goat cheese and trois oignons, roast pork with honey-cider vinegar sauce, a rolled French omelet with tapenade verte and sheep's milk cheese. The desserts also warrant special mention, including favorites like clafouti, tarte tatin, and madeleines (including lime pecan!) alongside walnut cake with cognac-brown butter frosting, apricot-pine-nut cakelettes, and a lemon curd crème brûlée that are the perfect sweet finish to your French meal.<br /><br />If you're interested in French cooking but you find Julia Child intimidating, this is the book for you. It perfectly captures the flavors and ambiance of France while making classic recipes accessible to a new generation of cooks with limited time (and access to French supermarkets!). Wini is a most engaging tour guide through the various facets of French cuisine and regional variations, and the recipes are clearly written and not intimidating at all. A list of U.S.-metric conversions for liquid and weight conversions and oven temperature is also provided at the back. Bon appétit!\",\n",

       "  'title': 'A nice addition to \"Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day,\" but not as versatile',\n",
       "  'text': 'When [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first came out, it revolutionized my bread baking. Before, I would use my Cuisinart bread machine once or twice a month, but with \"Artisan Bread in 5,\" I would bake at least once a week using the book\\'s no-knead method to produce brioche, challah, and caramel pecan rolls that rivaled those from my local bakery. When the sequel [[ASIN:0312545525 Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day: 100 New Recipes Featuring Whole Grains, Fruits, Vegetables, and Gluten-Free Ingredients]] came out, I found fewer recipes that appealed to me; most of the \"whole-grain\" recipes still called for large amounts of refined white flour and added wheat gluten.<br /><br />So when I saw \"Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day,\" I was willing to give it a shot. Normally, I\\'ll just purchase frozen pizza dough, so I was looking forward to making my own using the same method I\\'d had success with for breads and rolls. Be forewarned: the book is primarily a pizza dough book, with numerous variations on the master dough recipe (\"00\" flour, which is what is used in Italy for pizza and pasta), semolina, whole wheat, spelt, cornmeal olive oil) and various international breads like naan (there was a naan recipe in the first \"Artisan Bread in 5,\" but this one includes the tenderizing addition of yogurt), chapati, homemade tortillas (corn and flour), and injera.<br /><br />The pizza sauces are more of an afterthought to the dough; the basic \"tomato topping\" consists of \"four 14.5-ounce or two 28-ounce cans crushed or diced tomatoes: the world\\'s simplest pizza topping.\" The homemade barbecue sauce is a winner, though, with its complex flavor profile of orange juice, dark brown sugar, chili powder and paprika in addition to tomatoes, onion, ketchup and vinegar. You\\'ll also find recipes for pesto, bechamel, and tomatillo sauce. The pizza recipes themselves include some interesting combinations like curried sweet potato, lentil and arugula, Brussels sprouts, smoked pancetta and pecorino, and rainbow beet pizza. Instructions for cooking pizza on an outdoor grill are also included. The cheesy breadsticks are easy to throw together and are far superior to most chain restaurants\\' breadsticks.<br /><br />In addition to the pizzas and flatbreads, there\\'s also a nice assortment of easy-to-make Mediterranean dips, including hummus (their version uses 1/2 cup tahini, which results in a silky-smooth texture), baba ghanoush, the underappreciated ajvar (a Croatian spread made from roasted red peppers), the Greek dips tzatziki and skordalia, Italian caponata, and French tapenade, that are perfect to whip together for an informal get-together. There are a few substantial soups with international flair, including curried lentil soup, Cuban black bean soup, Scandinavian fish soup, and Spanish Galician Potato Soup with Greens and Chorizo. The desserts are kind of an afterthought and definitely one of the weaker points of the book.<br /><br />Like most good baking books, ingredients are measured by volume (U.S.) and U.S. and metric weights. For baking, weighing is more accurate than volume, since flour can absorb moisture (and thus become denser), altering the amount of flour on a dry vs. humid day. My advance reader copy has relatively few black-and-white photos, so I can\\'t comment on the final printing, but what step-by-step photos are provided are helpful.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you\\'re new to the 5-minute, no-knead method (this is NOT the same one as [[ASIN:0393066304 My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method]] or [[ASIN:1118169433 Kneadlessly Simple: Fabulous, Fuss-Free, No-Knead Breads]], as you\\'re not baking the bread at very high heat inside a Dutch oven), I recommend picking up [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first, as it\\'s simply more versatile than \"Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day.\" If you\\'re looking specifically for practical pizza dough recipes, then this is the book for you!<br /><br />P.S.: It\\'s well worth the investment to purchase a baking stone, pizza peel and [[ASIN:B002PMV77G Cambro RFS6PPSW2190 6-Quart Round Food-Storage Container with Lid, Set of 2]] to help you get started.

       "  'text': 'I first heard about \"The Fearless Baker\" through Sur La Table\\'s \"Fearless Baker\" cooking classes, and was intrigued. I\\'d expected the recipes to stick to simple (read: bland) beginner\\'s recipes like sugar cookies, but far from it: you\\'ll find exotic touches like cardamom shortbread (cardamom is a popular seasoning in Scandinavian baking as well as a staple of Middle Eastern dishes), pine nut fig cookies, and orange date ricotta tartlets. Emily gives new bakers the tools to learn and master baking techniques (toasting nuts, cutting butter into dough for pie crusts, etc.) through a series of clever sidebars consisting of dialogues between Emily and her Fearful Bakers (FB).<br /><br />When I first started out on my own as a baker in 2006, I had precious little baking experience other than licking the spoon or dropping cookie dough onto waiting cookie sheets as a kid. After several years living overseas or in dorms without a kitchen, I finally took the plunge and began baking, first with simple quick breads, then Bundt cakes, then on to yeast breads and laminated dough. There were several messy (and occasionally expensive) mishaps and missteps along the way, and I only wish that Emily Luchetti\\'s \"The Fearless Baker\" had been around at the time!<br /><br />There are nearly 200 recipes to choose from. I\\'m more of a breakfast baker myself (I love a good coffee cake, babka, or muffin), and curiously enough, the breakfast section is the very last one in the book. You\\'ll find a tempting array of scones, muffins, breakfast breads, sticky buns, and more to get your day off to a sweet start.  This might be the best place to start if you\\'re brand new to baking; there are very few steps (or dirty dishes involved) to whip up quick bread or muffins.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried from Fearless Baker was the mocha cream cheese brownies. I used Scharffen Berger Mocha bars from a previous Amazon Vine newsletter (the original recipe called for semisweet), and the mocha chocolate added an additional dimension of coffee flavor (there is instant coffee in the mocha cream cheese layer; I used espresso powder). The cream cheese layer was about twice the thickness of the brownie layer, and despite my best attempts to marble the cream cheese and brownie layers, it was so thick that it didn\\'t cut through the brownie layer (they still tasted wonderful). I also had to add an additional ten minutes onto the baking time.<br /><br />The next recipe up was the chocolate orange crinkle cookies. These unassuming little cookies pack a citrusy punch from grated orange peel and orange liqueur, bound together with ground toasted hazelnuts and a lot of melted bittersweet chocolate. The dough is really wet due to the liqueur and melted chocolate, so it needs to firm up in the fridge for an hour or so before baking. You roll the balls in granulated then powdered sugar before baking, so they have a pronounced crinkle effect. I may not have let the dough chill enough, though, since the powdered sugar became soft and gummy as the cookies came out of the oven, and I had to add extra powdered sugar after the cookies had cooled.  But the end result was fabulous; the citrus added a burst of unexpected sunshine to the delicate, airy dough.<br /><br />The book\\'s typeface is clear and easy to read, with required equipment printed in orange and ingredients in black. The whimsical vintage art brings to mind 1950s cookbooks. Instead of food stylist-tweaked food photos, you\\'ll see photos of actual Fearful-to-Fearless Bakers in their home kitchens as they work their way through the recipes.  It\\'s yet another way that The Fearless Baker serves to ease new bakers into the kitchen in a friendly, down-to-earth manner. However, if you\\'re someone who likes to see color photos for each recipe, you might be a tad disappointed.<br /><br />Even if you already know your Bundt pan from a batter bowl, there are plenty of creative, tasty recipes that pair uncommon partners to delicious effect (golden raisin-lime scones, lemon prosecco sabayon, pineapple-raspberry upside-down cake). There\\'s something to appeal to everyone\\'s sweet tooth, and even experienced bakers may learn a new trick or two; I know I did!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Janna W.)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Bring an authentic taste of Tuscany to your table',\n",
       "  'text': 'I recently spent three weeks in Northern Italy, including Tuscany (Siena, Volterra, Pisa, and Florence). Along the way, I had the opportunity to sample regional Tuscan specialties at numerous osterias, including several Slow Food restaurants. Upon returning home, I was looking for a cookbook that would capture the magical essence of the Tuscan landscapes, honeyed sunsets, and simple but soulful cooking that I\\'d enjoyed. When I heard about \"Cucina Povera,\" I contacted the author, who was kind enough to write back almost immediately and send a review copy via her publicist.<br /><br />Pamela Sheldon Johns gives culinary workshops in several regions of Italy, and  is the owner of an agriturismo in Montepulciano that has a 1,250-tree olive farm. A regular visitor to Italy for nearly three decades, she has written sixteen cookbooks, many with distinctly Italian themes ([[ASIN:1580089232 Gelato!: Italian Ice Creams, Sorbetti, and Granite]], [[ASIN:0743226801 The Williams-Sonoma Collection: Risotto]], [[ASIN:B000OV1C5W Prosciutto, Pancetta, Salame]], etc.). Her latest work \"Cucina Povera: Tuscan Peasant Cooking\" focuses on peasant dishes borne of necessity and hardship that are now served in restaurants around the world.<br /><br />Hit particularly hard during and after WWII, many Tuscan families lived on the brink of starvation, forced to forage and hunt. Leftovers were scrupulously reused, particularly unsalted bread. This gave rise to dishes like ribollita (\"reboiled\" soup made from vegetables, olive oil, and stale bread) and panzanella (bread salad dressed with tomatoes and olive oil). \"Cucina Povera\" includes several personal stories from elderly Italians who lived through dire poverty, and their memories of special foods that brightened otherwise difficult times. The memoirs provide a historical footnote to the recipes within without overwhelming the main function as cookbook (roughly the first forty pages are taken up by various interviews and introductions to various areas of Tuscany). There are interesting historical tidbits scattered throughout.<br /><br />Recipe titles are given in Italian in a large, flowing font with a smaller English translation underneath (both Italian and English titles are indexed, with the Italian recipe names printed in italics). Ingredients and instructions are straightforward and brief for many recipes. Most ingredients are limited largely to pantry staples and bread, olive oil, herbs, and fresh produce (the notable exception are the recipes calling for chestnut flour).  If you want to speed things along, using canned stock and canned cooked beans will speed up your cooking time.<br /><br />Some of the more unusual recipes that caught my eye were schiacciata all\\'uva (grape foccacia studded with walnuts), farinata toscana (cornmeal, kale, and bean soup), and pomodori, fagoioli e cipolline (roasted tomatoes, beans and onions). You\\'ll also find simple, comfort food favorites pici (fat rolled noodles), frittatas, polenta (including a chestnut variation), meat and game, and regional sweets like Sienese cantucci, ricciarelli, and brutti ma buoni.<br /><br />I tried making several of the recipes, starting with the roasted tomatoes, beans and onions. The recipe, like many in the book, relies on a few star ingredients, allowing the flavor of each to shine through. I tracked down cipolline onions and fennel to go with the potatoes, tomatoes, and cannellini beans. Perhaps it was the type of potato I used (baby Dutch yellow), but despite baking for the 35 minutes at 400 called for in the recipe, even after an additional hour of roasting, the potatoes remained hard (the other ingredients softened into a buttery sweetness, particularly the cipolline onions and fennel). The next time I make this, I may parboil the potatoes first. The next recipe was the farro soup, which uses a simple base of onion, garlic, carrot and celery to complement the nutty sweetness of the farro. A garnish of parsley adds a dash of bright flavor. Finally, the roasted chicken with vin santo is massaged with aromatic herbs and olive oil, and the pan drippings are then deglazed with marsala (or another fortified wine). The end result was soul-warming comfort food perfect for a blustery fall or winter\\'s day.<br /><br />The cookbook is gorgeous to look at as well, with heavy paper and deckled edges. The photography vividly captures various aspects of the Tuscan landscapes, from medieval skylines to its interviewed elderly residents cooking and preparing local food. There are a number of historic photographs as well as ample photos of finished dishes. The photographs and pages are matte, so there is no issue of glare if using a cookbook holder.  At the back are a list of resources and metric conversions and equivalents.<br /><br />This is a lovely cookbook that captures the flavors and history behind some of Tuscany\\'s well-known dishes, and a beautiful souvenir for those fortunate enough to have visited some of the varied Tuscan provinces highlighted within.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Andrews McMeel Publishing)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I have about 50 baking books ranging the gamut from heritage recipes like [[ASIN:1579125883 Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters: More than 100 Years of Recipes Discovered from Family Cookbooks, Original Journals, Scraps of Paper, and Grandmother\\'s Kitchen]] to regional baking of Italy, France, Turkey, and Mexico. When I saw the Taste of Home Baking book, I jumped at the chance to review it.<br /><br />The recipes come in a sturdy three-ring binder with a removable plastic splashguard. I loved the idea of the splashguard, although I would have liked to see a notes section at the back. The inside covers contain a handy list of food equivalents and ingredient substitutions, and the primer on baking basics is illustrated with numerous color photos.<br /><br />Index:<br /><br />Cookies<br />Cakes<br />Bars<br />Cupcakes<br />Cheesecakes<br />Pies and tarts<br />Desserts<br />Quick Breads<br />Muffins, Biscuits, and Scones<br />Yeast Breads<br />Yeast Rolls<br />Coffee Cakes and Sweet Rolls<br />Almost Homemade<br />Trimmed-Down Favorites<br />Holiday Classics<br /><br />Each recipe has a short comment or introduction by its author, along with the author\\'s name and hometown. The recipe ingredients are printed in an easy-to-read bold font, and steps are clearly numbered. There is no nutritional info provided.<br /><br />You\\'ll find plenty of familiar favorites here, along with some new and intriguing combinations. For years, our family made snowballs, a nut-and-butter cookie with a hidden Hershey\\'s Kiss in the center. I found an instant new favorite in the chocolate macadamia meltaways; a similar idea, except that you make chocolate-and-macadamia centers, chill them, then wrap the macadamia butter dough around them and bake.<br /><br />For those who have always wanted to try working with yeast, but found it intimidating, this is the perfect guide to demystify the process. There are several chapters on yeast breads, yeast rolls, and sweet rolls, and each chapter opens with a sidebar containing helpful hints. There is a whole page of color photos with step-by-step illustrations of kneading, shaping, and baking yeast bread, tips and troubleshooting for baking in bread machines, how to shape bagels, pretzels, cloverleaf rolls, and more.<br /><br />If you\\'re in a time crunch, the \"Almost Homemade\" chapter uses box mixes with personalized touches to create quick (and giftable) creations. The \"Trimmed Down\" chapter includes low-fat, egg-free, gluten-free and lactose-free recipes. Holiday recipes features kid-friendly favorites, mostly decorated sugar cookies (boneyard cookies, shamrock cookies, shortbread ornament cookies, etc.).<br /><br />This is a great go-to baking reference that covers all major baking categories with step-by-step guidance and plenty of photos. It would make a great gift for new bakers (or college students), since most ingredients are easy to find and there are many simplified recipes that require little time and few ingredients. To sweeten the deal, the book also comes with a free one-year subscription to [[ASIN:B004GVZUU4 Taste of Home (1-year auto-renewal)]].',\n",

       "  'text': 'In the Small Kitchen follows the adventures of Cara and Phoebe, two twentysomethings who are longtime friends and foodies. After college, the two remained fast friends and budding chefs, dealing with the post-college reality of juggling a full-time job with entertaining. Said entertaining relied largely on improvisation, limited resources (and budget), and the generosity of friends to provide wine. Predictably, the first chapter, Getting Started, includes a bare minimum of necessary kitchen tools. Similarly, kitchen staples lean towards the tested and true, including stock, pasta, rice, canned and dried beans, canned tomatoes, and baking essentials. I loved the fact that \"At the Market\" told how to pick out perfectly ripe produce; something that\\'s often overlooked in other cookbooks.<br /><br />The \"Cooking for One\" section is worth the price of the book alone. All too often, I find myself with way too many leftovers, and these quick, fun recipes are perfect for late-night snacks or a quick dinner when you don\\'t have the time or energy for much else. I loved the peas with white wine and butter, yogurt \"carbonara,\" olive oil fried egg, and Cara\\'s classic gooey grilled cheese.<br /><br />Along the way, Cara and Phoebe spice things up with tales of kitchen disasters and dating woes (\"The Frenchman\" was a classic!). The chapters are loosely arranged by functions, including potlucks, cocktail parties, dinner parties, brunch, and gift ideas (quick breads and cookies). There are budget-friendly ideas, veggie-friendly dishes (four magic words: smoky chipotle vegetarian chili!), and lots of international flair, including chana bateta, coconut peanut sauce, Mediterranean lamb burgers, and pineapple-cashew fried rice.<br /><br />The accompanying photos are a combination of mouthwatering dishes and lighthearted moments with the authors, including childhood photos. There is no nutritional info provided. The included menu suggestions are rather extensive, and curiously enough, the book closes out with \"prep school,\" which would have been better suited at the front after kitchen essentials, but overall, \"In the Small Kitchen\" is a gem of a book that blends delicious, easy-to-prepare dishes with stories that most of us can relate to about life, love, and culinary adventures and mishaps.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I used this book to research potential attractions for an upcoming trip to Italy (Stresa, Milan, Venice, Cinque Terre), although not as a primary guide (for that, I split duties between [[ASIN:1598806580 Rick Steves\\' Florence and Tuscany 2011]] and [[ASIN:0756669537 Florence and Tuscany (EYEWITNESS TRAVEL GUIDE)]] since most of my trip is in Tuscany). I have several other Fodor\\'s guides, and Fodor\\'s Venice and the Best of Northern Italy doesn\\'t disappoint. It\\'s full of useful sightseeing tips taken from Fodor\\'s message boards, gorgeous photos, and really handy maps, particularly the bird\\'s-eye view on cruising the Grand Canal, which points out notable buildings and attractions with concise footnotes. There\\'s a hefty emphasis on regional foods and even handy primers on language differences between regions.<br />There is also much space devoted to art and architecture, particularly the multi-page spread on Andrea Palladio\\'s distinctive architecture.<br /><br />Predictably, Venice alone takes up over forty percent of the book. There is a handy removable laminated map in back that includes sightseeing information and also includes the vaporetto routes.  A good portion of those two hundred pages is restaurant reviews and shopping advice; you\\'ll find recommendations on where to find handmade crafts like gilded picture frames, handmade lace (much of what is currently sold in Venice is machine-made in China or Taiwan), coda di pavone, and yes, Murano glass and masks. If you\\'re looking for Italian designers, you\\'ll find several pages devoted to high fashion, including the addresses of trendy Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, Prada, Gucci, Bulgari, Versace and more shops in \"The Fashionista\\'s Milan.\"<br /><br />I will be visiting several of the towns in Cinque Terre, and would have liked to see more space devoted to each town, rather than the brief one-paragraph overview that each is given. I realize that these are small towns with loads of tourists, but surely each of the five contains some notable churches, museums, shops, etc.? Some of the cities felt like tacked-on afterthoughts, and I could have done with less food coverage and more in-depth info, but overall, this is a good starting point for planning a trip to Northern Italy.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Quick and easy vegetarian recipes that are heavy on processed products',\n",
       "  'text': \"I became vegetarian during grad school. Living in the dorm, I didn't have direct access to a kitchen, either. This necessitated frequent trips to the local co-op / organic store. Student's Vegetarian Cookbook for Dummies is perfect for this scenario: busy student, not much time (or space) to cook. Many of the included recipes take five or less minutes to throw together.<br /><br />The first 85 pages or so are dedicated to understanding reasons for a vegetarian diet, living the vegetarian lifestyle, and basic cooking methods and tools. If you have a basic knowledge of cooking, that is more than enough, since most of time these recipes simply involve unwrapping and microwaving. The instructions were so simple that this would be an appropriate book for teens (it's literally things like how to assemble a sandwich or veggie burger). I was also put off by the fact that so many of the ingredients are heavily processed (soy meats, vegetarian gravy, Pasta Roni seasoning packets).<br /><br />The biggest issue for me was that so little of the included recipes sounded remotely appetizing. There is nutritional info provided; many of the suppers relied extensively on potatoes and pasta and had calorie and fat counts that were rather high (600+ calories for the smothered potatoes, 538 calories for the Athena's Potatoes, 646 calories and 39 g fat for the Blue Cheese Fettuccine). That's not to say that healthier vegetarian options aren't present; many of the five-minute lunches have much lower calorie counts and rely on whole grains, veggies, cottage cheese, hummus, and beans, but if you ate the included supper ideas on a regular basis, it could easily pack on the weight.<br /><br />Overall, this would be a good first book for those who are new to the kitchen; the included recipes are so simple that you'll want to move to something a little more challenging, like [[ASIN:0767927478 Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone]] or [[ASIN:0764524836 How to Cook Everything Vegetarian: Simple Meatless Recipes for Great Food]]. Personally, I prefer [[ASIN:1557884382 The PDQ (Pretty Darn Quick) Vegetarian Cookbook: 240 Healthy and Easy No-Prep Recipes for Busy Cooks]] and [[ASIN:0399535616 Supermarket Vegan: 225 Meat-Free, Egg-Free, Dairy-Free Recipes for Real People in the Real World]] as my go-to for quick, simple, and satisfying vegetarian / vegan food.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Homestyle Japanese cooking demystified',\n",
       "  'text': 'Debra Samuels, a longtime resident of Japan, demystifies Japanese homestyle cooking in \"My Japanese Table.\" Included are such favorites as sushi (including hand-rolled sushi and chirashi-zushi), skewers (grilled mixed veggie and tofu, chicken), donburi (one-dish meat and rice bowls), okonomiyaki (cabbage and egg \"pancakes\"), and a whole chapter devoted to bento, ornate Japanese lunchboxes prepared according to a strict balance of colors, flavors, and ingredients. I liked the photos of Debra\\'s chrysanthemum bento box so much that I ordered an identical one from Japan!<br /><br />\"My Japanese Table\" is a perfect starting point if you\\'re new to Japanese cooking; it\\'s not as intimidating or complicated as other Japanese cookbooks, and it uses commonplace American supermarket ingredients whenever possible. The vibrant photography and clear font make it especially easy to read and cook with. The thorough intro on Japanese cuisine includes the handy mnemonic device of \"sa shi su se so\" (the Japanese hiragana letters that correspond to sugar, salt, vinegar, soy sauce, and miso, the staples of the Japanese kitchen). And kudos for a particularly helpful section on Japanese ingredients with clearly labeled photos to match. There is also a handy bibliography and list of shopping resources (mostly online).<br /><br />Like Tuttle Publishing\\'s other Asian cookbooks, \"My Japanese Table\" is designed to fit today\\'s busy lifestyle and includes many main-course recipes that take 30 minutes or less to cook using common (U.S.) supermarket ingredients (both the prep times and cooking times are helpfully included at the top of each recipe). Another bonus is that measurements are given both in metric and imperial measurements; no need to convert if you\\'re cooking overseas.<br /><br />I just spent six months working in (and cooking my way across) Japan, so I was really looking forward to testing these recipes. First up were the colorful matcha mochi cupcakes. Mochi are sticky pounded rice cakes (no relation to American \"rice cakes\") traditionally served at New Year\\'s, but variations of mochi are found in many common Japanese desserts. I made the cupcakes as instructed and sprinkled cinnamon on top, but they still needed a little something extra, so I added the matcha frosting from [[ASIN:1584797215 Baked: New Frontiers in Baking]]. This gave the cupcakes an extra boost of grassy green tea flavor (and color) with a touch of sweetness (see attached photos).<br /><br />Next up, I tried several of the vegetarian recipes like the Sweet Simmered Mushrooms, Pumpkin Rounds and Japanese Mushroom Mélange with Butter and Soy. In some cases, I found that I had to adjust the cooking time. In the case of the mushroom mélange, you\\'re instructed to bake 2 pounds of mushrooms for 15 minutes (the cooking time at the top said 20), but I had to bake them for closer to 30 before the mushrooms released their juices. Also, it was difficult to fit two pounds of mushrooms into a 10 x 13 piece of parchment paper as instructed!<br /><br />I was happy to see that some traditional Japanese desserts were included, mostly focused on mochi, anko (sweet red bean paste), and green tea. You\\'ll find favorites like ichigo daifuku (ripe strawberries wrapped in a layer of bean paste and coated in mochi) and matcha and black sesame ice creams. The chapter is rounded out with instructions on how to prepare several kinds of traditional teas (sencha, matcha, and hojicha).<br /><br />Debra is a patient teacher (Tuttle has dubbed her \"The Julia Child of Japanese cooking\") and frequently defers to Japanese colleagues, or includes stories of her life in Japan that makes \"My Japanese Table\" part cookbook and part travelogue. The book could have benefited from a little extra proofreading (there were several typos in addition to mismatches between stated cooking times, conflicting instructions, etc.), but overall \"My Japanese Table\" has something to appeal to everyone, from the meat-and-potatoes crowd to vegetarians to kids (there are several cute bento box suggestions aimed specifically at kids and teens).<br /><br />(Many thanks / arigatou gozaimasu to Tuttle Publishing for generously providing a review copy)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I was stationed in Japan for six months, and while there, I took four Japanese cooking classes. I purchased Kansha from Amazon Japan in December 2010, and enjoyed leafing through the many intriguing vegan recipes inspired by traditional Japanese Buddhism (because of my living arrangements in Japan, I didn\\'t have a kitchen in which to try out these recipes). Being vegetarian in Japan is more difficult than it sounds; nearly every Japanese dish (with the exception of shojin ryori, vegan Buddhist temple cuisine) contains fish in some form, whether in the dashi (stock) or shavings of katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes). The traditional Japanese diet, which was heavy on fish and fresh and pickled vegetables, is being replaced by deep-fried cutlets and American-style fast food joints like Mos Burger.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to attend one of Elizabeth\\'s Kansha workshops in Osaka shortly after the March 11 earthquake, and it was a much-needed chance to focus on appreciation (the English translation of \"kansha\") that my Japanese coworkers\\' and students\\' friends and families were safe. We made several of the recipes from Kansha around a hanami (cherry blossom viewing) theme, including Thick Fried Tofu & Broiled Tofu Braised with Root Vegetables, Simmered & Blanched Mountain Vegetables Tossed in Nutty Tofu Sauce. Rice with Salted Cherry Blossoms, Burdock and Wheat Strips in Dark Miso Broth, and Home-Made Nuka-Zuke. After the class, we went on a supermarket tour, where Elizabeth pointed out various types of sansai (wild mountain vegetables) and gave us a primer on soy sauces and basic pantry staples.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the book is marketed as \"Vegetarian and vegan traditions,\" Kansha is totally vegan (if you\\'re looking for egg-based dishes like Japanese omelettes and chawanmushi, those can be found in Elizabeth\\'s previous book Washoku). You\\'ll find mock-mackerel sushi made from eggplant, light and springy cherry blossom rice, and a variety of pickles. There are some lovely regional recipes like goya (bitter melon), a popular vegetable from Okinawa, where it is commonly served in a stir-fry known as chanpuru. Yes, tofu gets its own chapter, but it\\'s served in a variety of preparations that are commonly found in Japan, including a soymilk version of chawanmushi (steamed custard with savory bits of veggies), fried tofu (atsu age), yuba (rather substantial soymilk \"skin\"), and instructions on how to make your own tofu from soymilk. Varietal tofus (especially fried tofu skins used for inarizushi and in miso soup) may be near-impossible to find in your local grocery, but you can always fall back on that most Japanese staple of summer, hiyayakko: buy the highest-grade tofu you can find, cut into cubes, garnish with grated daikon, wasabi, or fresh grated ginger, drizzle with soy sauce and serve!<br /><br />The book is gorgeously illustrated, and the recipes are very clearly laid out and explained step-by-step. The ingredient and kitchen tool section is excellent as well, but again, you will most likely have to mail-order many of the specialty items like rice molds, miso strainers, etc. I\\'ve ordered from Korin.com; they have a wide selection of imported Japanese tableware and kitchen tools.<br /><br />The biggest challenge that home cooks will face is finding authentic fresh Japanese ingredients like mitsuba and shiso (herbs), burdock root, and takenoko (baby bamboo shoots) and prepared ingredients like dried seaweed (most US stores only carry nori sheets for sushi, but there are many common varieties in Japan, like hijiki, kombu, and wakame), umeboshi (pickled plums), and seasonings (unfortunately, our Japanese market did stock konnyaku, my most loathed Japanese ingredient; imagine a squiggly, translucent, chewy block of tasteless speckled jello).<br /><br />I\\'m lucky in that my city has not one, but several Japanese markets and a large network of Japanese, but it\\'s still difficult (and extremely expensive) to buy these ingredients in the US (I miss my local Heiwado grocery store in Japan!). Unfortunately, these recipes call for very specific ingredients without American substitutions, so for some Kansha may end up as a beautiful coffee table book. It\\'s a beautiful volume and fine companion to [[ASIN:1580085199 Washoku: Recipes from the Japanese Home Kitchen]], which includes Japanese fish, meat and egg dishes, and vegetarians, vegans, and Japanophiles should certainly add this to their collection. If you\\'re looking specifically for Japanese Buddhist temple cuisine (which is vegan), [[ASIN:4770024932 The Enlightened Kitchen: Fresh Vegetable Dishes from the Temples of Japan]] covers that niche in greater detail.',\n",

       "  'title': 'An authentically delicious overview of Mexican desserts',\n",
       "  'text': 'Mexico\\'s dulces (sweets) are a blend of indigenous ingredients melded with European traditions, and in \"My Sweet Mexico,\" Mexican native Fany Gerson brings these sweet indulgences to vivid life. A Culinary Institute of America alumna and the granddaughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Fany is no stranger to the melding of two worlds. Some of the oldest recipes here are ancient drinks like atole (ground corn; the word \"atole\" comes from atl, water, and tlaoli, ground corn). Others stem from Spain\\'s Arabic heritage, like mazapan, alfajor de miel, and orange blossom water (even the Spanish word, azahar, comes from Arabic).<br /><br />The included illustrations and photos bring the varied facets of modern Mexico to life: as you first open the cookbook, the endpapers recreate azulejos (glazed tiles) and a colonial wooden door that gives way to photos of antique candy shops, exotic tropical fruits like soursops and mameys, gorgeous food photos and local artisans hard at work. The book starts with an in-depth primer on ingredients and tools. A note: many of the more exotic fruits that Fany uses, like tecojote, mamey, or zapote negro, may be difficult to find. Because they are ingredient-specific recipes, there are no substitutions for these recipes. But they are few in number, and the other ingredients should be readily available in your area.<br /><br />For those new to Mexican desserts, I would recommend starting with one of the simpler recipes like jamoncillo de leche (milk fudge). The milk fudge has few ingredients and is made in one pot; I made it with the suggested variation of evaporated goat\\'s milk, and it\\'s like a firmer version of cajeta (dulce de leche). Be prepared for much stirring and waiting; it takes about 30-40 minutes for the mixture to reach the right consistency. There are also several suggested flavor variations like coffee (I used 2 tsp. reconstituted instant espresso in place of coffee extract), lime, etc. to mix it up a bit. This is one that would be great for gifting around the holidays.<br /><br />The importance of corn in the Mexican diet can\\'t be overlooked, and corn gets its own chapter, with such entries as pemoles (coffee-flavored corn cookies), sweet fried masa cakes, and fruit tamales. In other chapters, there are unexpected gems like bean candy, which reminded me of the sugared beans I would snack on in central Japan, or the amaranth \"Happiness\" candy, a heavenly combination of nuts, dried fruits, honey, and puffed amaranth seeds. Candied fruits are another staple; I love Mexican candied pumpkin, and Fany demystifies the process, suggesting several variations like candied prickly pears, tamarind pods, papaya and chayote. The coconut-stuffed limes glisten like emeralds, hiding an unexpected (but fitting) filling.<br /><br />The chapter on \"pan dulce\" (sweet breads) is near and dear to my heart; I live in a city surrounded by Mexican bakeries, and I love to browse the cases stacked with ever-changing assortments of brightly-colored pastries. I particularly liked Fany\\'s recipe for huachibolas (cream cheese morning rolls); the yeast dough hides a surprise filling of cream cheese (I tried the recipe using Neufchatel cream cheese). Fany also chronicles old-fashioned sweets like candied nuts and caramels, some with pronounced tropical flavors, like gaznates (fritters filled with mezcal meringue) or lime meringues. There\\'s even a chapter on frozen desserts (Mexican ice pops and ice creams), with some truly surprising (and refreshing) flavor combos on display, including avocado, corn, and cheese ice creams, spicy mango ice pops, and rose petal sherbert. (Fany just published her second cookbook, [[ASIN:1607740354 Paletas: Authentic Recipes for Mexican Ice Pops, Shaved Ice & Aguas Frescas]], if you are looking for a more in-depth guide to Mexican frozen desserts.)<br /><br />Finally, the book closes with \"Mexico Moderno\" (Modern Mexico), ten recipes that Fany created to pay homage to \"the new Mexico,\" one that blends imported influences with traditional flavors. Recipes include a decadent chocolate-rum tres leches cake, cheesecake with spiced quince, upside-down plantain cake, and mango bread pudding with tamarind sauce.<br /><br />\"My Sweet Mexico\" pays homage to Mexico\\'s cultural and geographical diversity, and Fany is an engaging tour guide. Each recipe includes informative tips, recipe origins, or notes about a specific artisanal shop that brings the recipes to life. The recipes themselves are clearly printed and easy to follow (if time-consuming); like all recipes, you may find that you need to adjust cooking times based on your cookware, oven temp, etc. They\\'re written in such a way that they\\'re not intimidating, making Mexican sweets accessible even for novice bakers. It\\'s a gem of a cookbook that deserves to be in your kitchen.<br /><br />(Review copy generously provided by Ten Speed Press)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Sally Ketchum longs to escape the narrow-minded neighbors of the East Texas dirt farm where she grew up. After the death of her barnstormer boyfriend Tex, Sally decides to apply for the WASP (Women Airforce Service Pilot) program based at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. Just traveling to Sweetwater brings several new adventures for Sally, including the appearance of glamorous model Dixie, a fellow WASP hopeful. The women face discrimination from the male military establishment, from catcalls to more serious incidents of sabotage on planes the WASPs were supposed to be ferrying. But their biggest challenge is that reptilian lawyer Ira Waterman is not only out to disband the WASP program, but he has something deeply personal against Sally as well.<br /><br />Sally\\'s instructors and classmates at Avenger form the bulk of the secondary characters, including crochety Mr. Skinner and Sally\\'s inept instructor pilot, Beau Bayard, and classmates Dixie, Twila, and Geri. Despite the vast differences in the women\\'s personal backgrounds, their love of flying unites them. They\\'re required to complete the same grueling PT and classroom training (including the Link trainer) as their male counterparts, but at a fraction of the pay. In addition, they have to pay their own room and board, buy their own uniforms, and as a civilian outfit, they weren\\'t even granted a military funeral if a WASP died in the line of duty (their families would have to pay to have their remains transported home for burial). The novel touches upon many of the real-life issues that WASP faced, and it\\'s obvious that the author did extensive homework into reading firsthand accounts of real WASP.<br /><br />\"Wings\" includes loads of technical details on WWII airframes that will thrill aviation buffs, but incorporates the information seamlessly into Sally\\'s top-notch piloting skills and classroom experience at Avenger. I felt as though I were soaring along with Sally as she put the PT-19 through its paces. The story seemed to hit some turbulence towards the climax (it stretched the realm of credibility several times), but overall \"Wings\" is an engaging read that WASP and aviation buffs will no doubt enjoy. The WASP are finally starting to get the recognition they so rightfully deserve; 175 surviving WASP were granted the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010. \"Wings\" paints a realistic picture of the grueling training and substandard flying conditions interspersed with the sheer thrill of flight and a wealth of historical details.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of McBooks Press)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Meghan Chase is heiress to a legacy she never dreamed of only a year ago. A half-mortal and the daughter of Oberon, king of the Summer Court, Meghan finds herself at the middle of an epic faerie battle against the encroaching Iron Fey; technology proves fatal to faerie magic, but as a half-breed, only Meghan can withstand Iron glamour. In this third Iron Fey novel, Meghan is once again called upon to stand up to the Iron Fey.<br /><br />Unlike the previous two Iron Fey novels, I never really was pulled into the story. The fabulous interplay of the secondary characters Puck, Grimalkin and Ironhorse in the previous Iron Fey novel, [[ASIN:0373210132 The Iron Daughter (Harlequin Teen)]], is largely absent here. Meghan\\'s indecision about her feelings for Ash and Puck is finally resolved, although she spends much of the novel debating if she should rush the physical aspect of the relationship or not. Many of the battles felt like overstaged cinematography a la \"Lord of the Rings;\" I could practically see the CGI effects as I read the battle scenes. I just didn\\'t feel the sense of wonder or tension as I did with Meghan\\'s previous adventures.<br /><br />Several storylines from previous novels are finally given a resolution, including that of Meghan\\'s biological father, who was previously introduced in The Iron Daughter. That\\'s not to say that these conclusions are always satisfying; there\\'s a sense of hopelessness that permeates the novel, and gone are the lighthearted jabs and dark humor.<br /><br />Fans of the Iron Fey series will want to read this to see the various resolutions, but if you\\'re new to the series, you\\'re better off starting off with The Iron King.',\n",

This time, however, Gamache is not in the quaint village of Three Pines but rather in Quebec City, where he has gone to try and recover from an horrific incident in his recent past.  Louise Penny\\'s description of Old Quebec in winter paints a perfect picture of the city\\'s charm and beauty.

The character of Armand Gamache continues to grow; \"Bury Your Dead\" explores his weaknesses as well as his strengths.<br /><br />There are actually three separate story lines that unfold simultaneously (one in flash backs) in this book: a murder in Quebec City, where the Chief Inspector has no jurisdiction but agrees to assist with the investigation; the reinvestigation of a murder in Three Pines by Gamache\\'s trusted colleague Jean Guy Beauvoir; and a sinister plot involving domestic terrorism.  The complexity and layers of the book are demanding of the reader, but in the end the effort is worth it.',\n",

       "  'title': \"A breathtaking race through Siena's dark secrets\",\n",
       "  'text': \"Siena, Tuscany, is famous for its Palio, a yearly event where ten of the city's seventeen Contrade compete in a brutal, blink-and-you-miss-it horse race. This tradition dates back to the 17th century in its present form. The Daughter of Siena is set in 1723, where Pia Tolomei, descendent of Queen Cleopatra, is told that she'll wed a man from a rival contrade on her nineteeth birthday. Hardly the news that Pia had hoped for. At the Palio the next day, a handsome stranger appears as the jockey for the Torre contrada. Pia is instantly drawn to him, unlike the cruel, calculating man her father has chosen for her. A shocking event puts a quick end to the normal Palio festivities, and the course of Pia's future is changed forever.<br /><br />The remainder of Pia's story is one of political intrigue and thwarted romance. This is no lighthearted historical romp; there are quite a few graphic scenes. There are several dark undercurrents involving murder, torture, madness, and gluttony that were uncomfortable to read at times. The author includes a virtual menagerie of unlikable secondary characters, from a snaggletooth abusive maid to a gluttonous gay Medici who indulges all his corporeal appetites with impunity. Many of the figures are based on actual historical figures (Violante, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Gian Gastone).<br /><br />Marina Fiorato excels at her vivid descriptions of the Palio; they're informative and engaging without disrupting the flow of the story, and one portion of the Palio narrative appears word for word in a later chapter, bringing the story full circle. The elegant descriptions of period clothing were in stark contrast to the cutthroat world of court politics and damp cellars and ruins where secret midnight meetings were held.  However, a good part of the plot feels recycled from Fiorato's earlier novel [[ASIN:0312606362 The Botticelli Secret (Reading Group Gold)]]. Still, fans of historical fiction (and Tuscany) will find much to recommend The Daughter of Siena.\",\n",

       "  'title': \"Tempe's 12th adventure finds her back in peak form\",\n",
       "  'text': '206 Bones is the 12th installment of spunky forensic anthropologist Temperance \"Tempe\" Brennan, who splits her time between La Belle Province (Quebec) and North Carolina working to identify victims\\' remains. In 206 Bones, Tempe gets to return to her old stomping grounds of Chicago. As in other Tempe novels, there are several separate cases that Tempe is working on at the same time. Tempe is searching for clues about several elderly women that have been brutally murdered, along with a missing grandson and the possible remains of a planeload of vacationers from decades ago.  The novel starts off with a bang as Tempe wakes up apparently blind, bound and with amnesia regarding recent events. This device is used to great effect between chapters as the action segues into the events that led to Tempe\\'s current predicament.<br /><br /> Reichs\\' excellent character descriptions really make the secondary characters come alive, from sleazy Chicago lawyers to creepy ex-cons fingered as suspects. Tempe is still testing the waters with former flame and coworker Andrew Ryan and she spends time with her ex-husband Pete\\'s boisterous Latvian in-laws. Her wonderful boss Pierre LaManche is out convalescing from bypass surgery, and the office climate takes a nosedive with the appearance of the mysterious newcomer Marie-Andr&eacute;a Briel.The pacing was perfect, with the tense present interludes sliding seamlessly into the facets of the investigations that led to the present. The resolutions to the various stories were plausible without overreaching as in some previous Tempe novels, and Tempe is in fine form. There\\'s an interesting new complication with Tempe\\'s cat Birdie and Tempe\\'s obnoxious new neighbor Sparky.<br /><br />My only gripe was with the final chapters. First, the explanation for Tempe\\'s situation; the villain seemed unlikely, from previous hints, and the motivation seemed kind of far-fetched. Also, on the very last page, Tempe gets on her soapbox about the various board examinations for forensics. It would been appropriate as an afterword, but having Tempe preach \"Accreditation is a rigorous process. Those letters behind a scientist\\'s name aren\\'t just for show. They\\'re hard-earned. And they\\'re a message that an expert has undergone peer scrutiny and meets a high set of ethical standards,\" etc. just felt forced and out of place as the novel was winding to a close, more as a personal note from the author than in character for Tempe and Ryan in an otherwise picture-perfect moment in front of the fire (the Acknowledgements also dedicates the book to Reichs\\' board-certified colleagues, with a list of the various boards).<br /><br />Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed 206 Bones, perhaps more than some of Tempe\\'s recent (mis)adventures. The tense pacing, the brutality of some of the cases, the hunt for suspects, the quirky in-laws and luscious food  descriptions (reminding me of my own Polish relatives) and variety of locations all made for an engrossing read.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bakery owners Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito\\'s dream was simple: they wanted to create a classic American bakery. Their flagship Baked store opened in Red Hook, Brooklyn in 2005, and the second opened in Charleston in 2009. In their first cookbook [[ASIN:1584797215 Baked: New Frontiers in Baking]], Matt and Renato focused on recreating classic American desserts like cobbler, red velvet cake, apple and pecan pies, and diner-style desserts tempered with more modern touches like matcha (green tea powder), chipotle, and generous sprinklings of fleur de sel. Chocolate stout milkshakes and green tea smoothies rubbed elbows with espresso martinis. It was main street diner meets Dean and DeLuca\\'s, and added numerous crowd-pleasers to my repertoire, including the classic Baked brownie and the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf.<br /><br />In their second cookbook \"Baked Explorations,\" Matt and Renato focus on comfort foods rather than innovation; there\\'s a much more retro feel in the photography and recipe selection, one that pays tribute to grandma\\'s kitchen and heirloom recipes in general. It\\'s like a culinary time capsule: the PB&J bars taste like grade school lunches, the no-bake peanut butter cookies bring back memories of time spent \"cooking\" with Mom in the kitchen, while the orange Creamsicle tart will take you back to childhood summers spent drinking orange soda (pop, Coke) on the front steps. Classic shortbread cookies, thumbprint cookies, and grasshopper bars (my grandmother used to make a very similar confection) conjure up memories of \"high tea\" with grandma and her neighborhood friends. That\\'s not to say that you won\\'t find any surprising combinations in here; there\\'s always the chocolate salt-`n\\'-pepper sandwich cookies, tomato soup cupcakes with mascarpone frosting, or rosemary apricot squares.<br /><br />The breakfast section features the lion\\'s share of recipes, with guest appearances by monkey bubble bread, pumpkin cheddar muffins, farm stand buttermilk doughnuts, Nutella scones, malted waffles, crumb cake, baked French toast, and baked cheese grits. For those who prefer their breakfasts to induce sugar comas, you\\'ll find oatmeal chocolate chip cake with cream cheese frosting and the sinfully decadent double-chocolate loaf with peanut butter cream cheese spread. Imagine biting into a Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup for breakfast, and you\\'ve got the general idea, although this is gussied up with Valhrona cocoa powder and Ghirardelli bittersweet chips. I found that the included amount of sugar for the peanut butter cream cheese spread was a tad too much for me (1/3 cup for 5 oz. cream cheese), so you may want to start with ¼ cup of sugar and sweeten to taste.<br /><br />Regional desserts, especially those rescued from the musty depths of community cookbooks, are featured prominently, including offerings from the Northeast (Maine\\'s Joe Froggers, NYC\\'s black and white cookie), buckeyes and heartland turtle bars from the Midwest, and strawberry Jell-o salad (even before I became a vegetarian, gelatin and I were on dubious footing). Southern cuisine gets a definite nod, with honey corn muffins, buttermilk pie, cowboy cookies, pudding bars, lady praline chiffon cake, and burnt sugar Bundt cake with caramel rum frosting. To appease the various factions of mud pie purists, there are two different versions of Mississippi Mud Pie; the first is a chocolate-drenched, bourbon-laced coffee ice cream tart, while the second, Muddy Mississippi Cake, is a flourless chocolate cake \"inside a cookie crust topped with a layer of silky chocolate pudding and whipped cream.\" Both are good enough to make you jump up and witness.<br /><br />As with their previous cookbook, \"Baked Explorations\" is beautifully laid out on high-quality paper. The endpapers are printed in a gorgeous gold-accented design that brought to mind Lomonosov porcelain. The eye-catching photography by Tina Rupp really pops, and this time around there are staged vignettes featuring antique china, vintage books, weathered bakeware, and various antiques scattered about. Reading each recipe\\'s introduction is part of the fun; ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out and broken into manageable steps, while Baked notes and variations are also featured. You\\'ll find a handy metric conversion chart and list of sources at the back, while helpful hints on ingredients, preparation, and storage can be found throughout. One note of warning: Matt and Renato don\\'t believe on skimping on quality ingredients, so you\\'ll see recommendations for Valrhona cocoa and other premium items. Use the best you can afford (or find), and your recipes will turn out memorably.<br /><br />This is one cookbook that more than lives up to the high expectations of its predecessor, and will make the perfect gift for any foodie on your list.<br /><br />(Review copy generously provided by Abrams)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane...',\n",
       "  'text': '\"The Farm Chicks Christmas\" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009\\'s [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well, Laugh Often, Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri, antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front), and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats, appetizers, soups and salads, and decadent desserts, over fifty in all.<br /><br />\"Farm Chicks Christmas,\" on the other hand, is written only by Serena, a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas; you\\'ll find decorative, retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back, along with various decorating ideas for \"the most wonderful time of the year.\" However, the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book; there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.<br /><br />\"Farm Chicks Christmas\" captures the magic of childhood Christmases, from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along), holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting, vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments, cone trees and vintage funnel trees, banners and more), and photos of Serena\\'s friends\\' and family\\'s homes decorated for Christmas.<br /><br />Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay, with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also, the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow, for example, or stacking metal funnels to make \"trees.\" If you\\'re not a fan of all things country, this probably isn\\'t the holiday book for you.<br /><br />The included holiday recipes are few, and aimed mostly at gift-giving, like the sweet and salty nuts, mini orange bundt cakes, and various types of cookies (butter cutouts, chocolate-covered peanut butter balls, snowballs, Spritz cookies). As with the previous book, a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first, and though tasty, I didn\\'t think that the \"sweet\" flavor predominated; it was more of a subtle afterthought (there\\'s only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).<br /><br />Overall, \"Farm Chicks Christmas\" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane, but it has narrower mass appeal than \"Farm Chicks in the Kitchen\" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs, but won\\'t find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Sterling Publishing)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Rick Rodgers, author of the delightful tome [[ASIN:0609604538 Kaffeehaus: Exquisite Desserts from the Classic Caf&eacute;s of Vienna, Budapest, and Prague]], returns to the subject of European-style coffee and baked goods in \"Coffee and Cake.\" The first forty pages or so are devoted to an excellent, in-depth coffee primer, which includes a brief history of coffee, \"coffee talk\" (flavor notes and adjectives used to describe coffees, similar to wine tasting), growing regions, brewing tips, a section devoted solely to espresso, and types of coffee pots.<br /><br />The included coffee recipes cover European territory such as Viennese coffees (fiaker), spiced mocha, Irish coffee, caf&eacute; brulot from New Orleans, and more far-flung variations such as Vietnamese and Thai  (iced) coffee, along with a DIY frappe recipe (ice cream, espresso and whole milk) and an espresso martini.<br /><br />As for the baking half, it\\'s kicked off by an excellent baking primer that would be helpful for novice bakers in particular. There\\'s in-depth discussion of ingredients, equipment, baking and cooling, and decorating. The cake recipes are divided into four parts. If you\\'re looking for comfort food, you\\'ll find heirloom recipes like apple-cranberry ginger loaf from the author\\'s grandmother, almond blueberry buckle, or cinnamon swirl coffee cake. For the kids (and kids at heart), there\\'s a section devoted to cupcakes and frosting. Gracious Southern-style cakes include ambrosia coconut cake and spice layer cake with praline frosting. You\\'ll also find new favorites like a S\\'mores cheesecake and chocolate cake with chocolate malt frosting.<br /><br />The first recipe that I tried was the apple-cranberry ginger loaf; I wrote the author to make sure that 2 cups unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup butter was correct, since that seemed like a lot of liquid for one loaf. Rick confirmed that it was. I made it minus the stick of butter in the interest of making the recipe low-fat and upped the ginger to 1/2 cup, and was rewarded with a moist, fruit-studded spice cake that would make a beautiful gift if baked in a decorative loaf pan like [[ASIN:B000QYN19M Nordic Ware  Pumpkin Loaf Pan]].  Rick advises baking in a 9 x 5 pan, or you\\'ll end up with extra batter. The apple-cranberry ginger loaf would also make great muffins for those chilly mornings on the go.<br /><br />The European-style cakes are where the book really shines, and they pair wonderfully with Viennese coffees such as the fiaker (for more of Rick\\'s European coffee recipes, try to find a copy of the excellent and out-of-print Kaffeehaus). Black Forest cake, moaahaccino torte, hazelnut gateau with coffee buttercream, chocolate-strawberry sachertorte, and tiramisu cake with mascarpone frosting will transport your tastebuds on a culinary vacation. The book wraps up with a handy (if brief) list of (online) sources, including Amazon.<br /><br />\"Coffee and Cake\" does run on the short side at only eleven coffee recipes and twenty-five for cake, but Rick\\'s excellent primers, engaging writing style, and step-by-step instructions make this a good choice for a novice baker, or for the hostess of a coffee (or book) club (it\\'s the perfect size to tuck into a gift basket). There are numerous beautifully-staged photos that show off the included recipes. It\\'s also printed in the US, which is becoming a rarity these days. More experienced bakers will want to try Rick\\'s Kaffeehaus (if you can find it), Doris Greenspan\\'s [[ASIN:0618443363 Baking: From My Home to Yours]] or Carole Walter\\'s [[ASIN:0307237559 Great Coffee Cakes, Sticky Buns, Muffins & More: 200 Anytime Treats and Special Sweets for Morning to Midnight]].',\n",

Each has a special talent; Gabriel is a warrior, Ivy a healer, and Bethany has yet to discover her powers. The three are living in a house in Venus Cove, where they\\'ve been sent to counteract the dark forces at work.<br /><br />Bethany is enrolled in the local Catholic high school, where she soon falls in with Molly and her crowd, and more importantly, Xavier, the school captain. Xavier has it all: he\\'s handsome, athletic, and most importantly, Catholic. He volunteers at soup kitchens and nursing homes in his spare time. The two begin a whirlwind romance at the risk of heavenly interception. Beth becomes so wrapped up in Xavier that she starts to shirk her community service duties. Meanwhile, transfer student Jake is a charming rebel with a dark streak...<br /><br />At nearly 500 pages, \"Halo\" reads fairly quickly for its length, but there\\'s a lack of depth. The author has a habit of overloading descriptive adjectives into a sentence, which affected the flow and, considering the level of Bethany\\'s reflections, the vocabulary level seemed too elevated to ring true (I expect that\\'s because of the author\\'s young age, and that her style will become more streamlined as she continues to write). The few descriptions of heaven seemed hastily drawn, as do Gabriel and Ivy, who conveniently appear when neccessary and come across as flat, when I would have liked to hear more about Bethany\\'s life before coming to Venus Cove.<br /><br />Much of Bethany\\'s story is taken up by trying to fit in at school (no \"modern technology\" is allowed at home, so she\\'s never seen a cell phone and doesn\\'t know about Facebook), or her all-consuming love affair (we\\'re constantly reminded how Xavier is gorgeous, perfect, etc., and she wallows in despair during his absences). Despite being an angel, she obsesses over prom dresses just as much as the next mere mortal (and is just as susceptible to human foibles involving alcohol at parties). She\\'s clueless about s-e-x, too, and solicits advice from dubious sources at school.<br /><br />But \"Halo\" isn\\'t all squeaky clean, even if Xavier believes in \"saving yourself until marriage,\" the angelic trio volunteers at soup kitchens and tries to bring people back to the church, and Gabriel counsels Molly to love her body the way it is instead of crash dieting. There\\'s some pretty graphic violence, but it\\'s starkly at odds with the Catholic messages running throughout the book. The \"evil\" ringleader was apparent fairly early on, which kind of ruined the suspense.<br /><br />Despite the length of the book, there were several subplots that could have been more fully developed, such as Alice\\'s story (Bethany adopts Alice\\'s dog Phantom early on). My main issue was that the Catholic themes seemed rather forcefully inserted at times (the dinner table discussion at Xavier\\'s, for example), and that Bethany is so busy being human that there is precious little time devoted to hearing about the heavenly Kingdom; the brief descriptions that are there feel abstract and vague. And several other minor quibbles will probably be corrected in the final print run, including numerous misspelled words that were distracting. Verdict: fans of \"Hush, Hush\" and \"Fallen\" will enjoy \"Halo.\"',\n",

Each of these souls possesses a unique talent: Julian raises the dead, Elijah tells the future, Eve can time travel, and Caleb is the brash, impulsive one who can possess other humans. Aden is constantly bombarded by all four yelling at him, which has led a diagnosis of schizophrenia, numerous mental institutions and juvie, from foster home to unhappy foster home.<br /><br />At his latest \"home,\" outside the D&M Ranch (think: home for troubled boys), Aden is off fighting off zombies when he experiences something he\\'s never felt before: total, blissful silence. The voices in his head are silent, and it\\'s because of a girl. He\\'s desperate to find out *how* she can stop the voices. As Aden and Mary Ann learn more about each other, more supernaturals enter the picture. Mary Ann\\'s new best friend is a large black wolf that follows her to and from school, and Aden becomes involved with a Romanian princess.<br /><br />Their stories intertwine into the complex plot; the various characters seek to resolve questions of their origins, several romances develop, all while trying to battle the twin horrors of high school and supernatural enemies. However, there were so many secondary characters and plot developments to keep track of that the plot sometimes felt spread too thinly, even though the book clocks in at almost 400 pages. At least one of the resolutions felt too conveniently \"Hallmark\"y, while the violent ending took the story in an entirely new direction. I feel that it would have been a more effective story if more of the secondary characters and plots had either been trimmed, or worked into future novels. It can be overwhelming at times, and I found myself losing focus more than once.<br /><br />The supernatural elements are handled well, if too briefly at times (such as the fairies, witches, and goblins introduced late in the novel), the four souls trapped in Aden\\'s head reminded me of the Robert Downey Jr. film [[ASIN:0783230079 Heart and Souls]], and several supernaturals have names that conveniently overlap with [[ASIN:031608736X Eclipse (The Twilight Saga)]]: the vampire Victoria and her bodyguard Riley come to mind. \"Intertwined\" will strongly appeal to fans of supernatural and paranormal romance. If you loved [[ASIN:0385736827 The Forest of Hands and Teeth]], [[ASIN:0385734212 Blood and Chocolate]], and vampires, \"Intertwined\" is for you.',\n",

       "  'text': '\"Immortal\" is a contemporary Gothic novel that, well, tries too hard to be a Gothic novel by throwing in just about every convention in the genre (gloomy setting, Gothic architecture, omens, supernatural events, evil, controlling villains, check). Evie Johnson is sent to Wyldcliffe Abbey School after her grandmother suffers a stroke (Evie\\'s mother died, and her father is a military officer stationed overseas). At sixteen, Evie has led a sheltered life growing up by the sea. Her first impression of Wyldcliffe isn\\'t a promising one; forced to walk to the abbey in the rain after the cab driver refuses to take her to \"that cursed place,\" she\\'s nearly run over by a mysterious, handsome, apparently consumptive man on a black horse.<br /><br />When she arrives, Evie discovers that she\\'s a charity case (I kept having flashbacks to \"A Little Princess\"). After an icy welcome from the school\\'s queen bee, she finds out that she\\'s expected to sleep in the bed of a dead girl. She\\'s not allowed to have cell phones, iPods, or other electronics. The building is apparently haunted. Her only escape comes from her nighttime visits to the mysterious stranger, but fellow charity student Helen seems determined to keep Evie away from him, going as far as to earn her demerits (three demerits equals one very unpleasant punishment, which becomes more clear as the novel progresses).<br /><br />The novel switches between Evie\\'s first-person narration and that of Agnes\\'s diary. I liked the idea of the diary, only it lessened the dramatic impact of the \"revelation\" dropped on page 268, which I\\'d figured out early into the story thanks to the foreshadowing. I did like how Evie\\'s language in the present mirrored Agnes\\'s diary entries, though, establishing a bond between them.  Wicca plays a large role, and I found the magic elements more engrossing than the \"romance\" between Evie and Sebastian. The descriptions of the various rituals and ingredients are described in detail. Dark magic and blood rituals are also explored towards the end of the novel, and I felt that those secondary characters involved in these activities were two-dimensional. The last third of the book, and the ending in particular, felt like it could have benefitted from more development; after long, slow passages, everything felt rushed.<br /><br />Overall, a fairly quick read, but it seems geared towards a younger audience. Shields manages to evoke a creepy atmosphere full of secret societies and ghosts wandering the moors. Fans of magic, paranormal romance and Gothic novels will enjoy Immortal. The sequel, Betrayal, picks up where Immortal leaves off.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Easy vegetarian recipes the whole family will love',\n",
       "  'text': '\"Good Housekeeping Family Vegetarian Cooking: 225 Recipes Everyone Will Love\" will appeal to a wide audience, from transitioning vegetarians (Chapter Nine is devoted to \"the Flexible Vegetarian\") to vegans (vegan recipes are clearly marked with a \"v\", and many recipes include sidebars on how to make a given recipe vegan).** One of my main problems as a vegetarian is how to make meals exciting; \"Family Vegetarian Cooking\" spices up meals with additions such as Macaroni and Cheese Deluxe, studded with peas, blue cheese, cherry tomatoes and toasted walnuts, or the Wheat-Berry Pilaf with Green Beans and Cranberries, rich with carrots, celery, onion, green beans and a dash of orange peel. There are loads of ethnic-inspired recipes like Vegetarian Souvlaki, Gingery Spinach-Lentil Stew, Vegetable Curry, Farro Risotto with Butternut Squash, Nacho Casserole, and Grilled Eggplant Caponata Salad to add zest to your meals. In addition to fresh fruits and veggies, you\\'ll find a wealth of grains, including farro, wheat berries, barley, quinoa, and bulgur cleverly worked into salads, veggie burgers, pilafs and casseroles. If you\\'re still of the mindset that \"vegetarian\" equals \"sprouts and avocados,\" you\\'ll find that as well, but with so many surprising (and mostly healthy) flavor combos, why not try something new tonight?<br /><br />Inside, you\\'ll find breakfast options, soups, salads, and sandwiches, stir fries and saut&eacute;s, casseroles, a chapter on grilling veggies and the aforementioned \"flexitarian\" chapter that caters to everyone (you use half meat and half tofu). There are many flexitarian Asian recipes in particular, including several stir fries, miso soup, and coconut curry soup. However, for those who are allergic to (or choose to avoid) soy products, the only veggie option given in the flexitarian chapter is tofu (processed soy is largely absent from the rest of the book, except for the occasional recipe calling for tempeh or soy sausage). I would have liked to see high-protein non-soy options such as seitan (wheat gluten) included. Desserts are largely fruit-based (Peach Hand Pies, Peach-Raspberry Galette, Summer Salsa with Sweet Tortilla Chips), and there are a few vegan options such as Vegan Chocolate Chip-Walnut Brownies, Deep Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes, and Vegan Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies that are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth.<br /><br />The recipes come together quickly by taking advantage of supermarket shortcuts such as canned beans and frozen veggies; you can speed up prep even more by purchasing prechopped veggies (onions, garlic, peppers) at your supermarket\\'s salad bar or produce section. Most, if not all, of the ingredients are probably already in your pantry or at your local supermarket. Handy sidebars (\"It\\'s So Good!\") extol the nutritional virtues of the various fruits and veggies featured in recipes. Nutritional info is provided for each recipe, but one caveat: just because a recipe is vegetarian or vegan doesn\\'t automatically make it low-fat; the vegan roasted vegetable pizza with soy sausage and soy mozzarella clocks in at 678 calories and 23 g fat. Many of the sandwiches and main-course meals have 300 calories or more; Whole-Wheat Pita Pizzas with Vegetables = 510 calories, Syrupy Banana-Nut Overnight French Toast = 570 calories and 20 g fat (11 g saturated), Stir-Fried Broccoli with Pasta = 690 calories and 30 g total fat. However, by tweaking the recipes, you can lower the fat and calorie content if desired. You can scale back on olive oil and use smaller portions of full-fat, flavorful cheeses; low-fat cheeses lack taste, texture, and meltability. Also, try serving smaller pasta portions; Americans tend to eat drastically larger pasta portions than in Italy, where pasta is simply a first-course dish out of many. For example, the broccoli and pasta dish calls for 12 ounces dried pasta for four people; if you read pasta labels, one pound is actually eight servings. Round out your meal with a green salad, and you\\'ll save calories and add more veggies at the same time.<br /><br />Verdict: the easy preparation and unusual flavor combinations (as well as new ideas for old standbys) make weeknight meal prep fairly painless, and the vibrant full-color photos of ingredients and final dishes are dramatic and visually appealing. This would be a good choice for your first vegetarian cookbook. Like all of Good Housekeeping\\'s recipes, all 225 have been triple-tested with a variety of substitutions and kitchen equipment to make sure that they\\'ll work in your kitchen. A handy metric equivalent chart is also provided at the back. Overall, this is a welcome addition that will be sure to appeal to flexitarians, vegetarians, and everyone in between.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Hearst Books)<br /><br />**A note regarding the vegan recipes: I found at least two \"vegan\" recipes that include honey as an ingredient (Lower-Fat Granola on page 22 and the Health Club Sandwiches on page 52). Also, in the introduction, the book describes vegans as \"someone who eliminates all animal food products from their diet - no meat or dairy products, poultry or eggs, or fish and shellfish.\" True enough, but vegans also abstain from animal-based products including honey (you can substitute agave syrup), refined cane sugar (which is frequently filtered through bone char), and gelatin (made from boiling bones and hides).',\n",

       "  'text': 'In \"Linger,\" the sequel to [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver]], ex-werewolf Sam tentatively embraces his lost boyhood (manhood?) after being cured of his curse. As the spring thaw brings the first fragile crocuses to Mercy Falls, Minnesota, he rediscovers the trappings of humanity that he was forced to shed during the endless winters of his adolescence (cold weather triggered the seasonal shift to wolf). Meanwhile, his steadfast girlfriend Grace grows sicker by the day, dogged by a raging fever and constant stomachache and plagued by nightmares of becoming a wolf (\"I choked on the wolf rising up inside me, pressing against the lining of my stomach, clawing inside my skin, trying to peel me inside out\"). Grace had been smuggling Sam into her bedroom for chaste sleepovers, but when Sam is discovered in her bed, the two are forbidden from seeing each other.<br /><br />Grace\\'s friend Isabel, still bitter from losing her brother Jack in \"Shiver,\" becomes involved with Cole St. Clair, one of the pack\\'s newest (were)wolves. Cole is a bitter, angry young rock star hellbent on self-destruction, and takes delight in razor-edged remarks and infidelities. He and his ex-bandmate Victor are anomalies in the werewolf world; Victor shifts several times an hour despite warm temperatures, and Cole is unable to shift at will and can\\'t make the change stick. He finds an unexpected ally in the wounded Isabel. The lives of Sam, Grace, Isabel and Cole are intertwined throughout the novel, and all four serve as narrators, with several narrators sharing each short chapter.<br /><br />The various narrations flow together fairly seamlessly and the silvery prose enchants, particularly the effective use of poetry by Rilke, Roethke, and Mandlestam, but \"Linger\" is plagued by some plot inconsistencies (continuity errors from \"Shiver\" that alter the story\\'s timeline) and stretches where not much occurs. Cole, as one of the newest characters, is given a large share of the narrative, but comes across as two-dimensional for much of the story (given Cole\\'s backstory, I found it hard to reconcile the depths of his personal agony with that of Sam, who had a much more disturbing childhood yet is much more well-adjusted). Also, a disturbing incident involving Isabel\\'s father and one of the secondary characters seems forced (in the first book, the run-in with Tom Culpepper served an important plot purpose).<br /><br />Stiefvater has a talent for poetry and stark imagery that brings the woods (and her characters) to vibrant life. Overall, Linger is a gripping, well-written read that will delight fans of the supernatural (and fans of werewolves in particular). The ending is clearly left open for \"Forever,\" the third and final novel in the \"Wolves of Mercy Falls\" trilogy.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Avery Hood\\'s parents were brutally murdered in the woods outside their house, and the only thing she remembers seeing is inhuman flashes of silver. Homeschooled and raised in the forest surrounding her ramshackle house, Avery is sent to live with Renee, her paternal grandmother. The two have been estranged for many years, and it\\'s an awkward living arrangement at best.<br /><br />Avery struggles to cope with soul-rending grief as everything she\\'s ever loved is taken away from her, especially her deep connection to the forest. When mysterious new boy Ben Dusic appears at school, Avery is intrigued and soon discovers that Ben is more than he appears...his silver eyes hint at his supernatural heritage.  Strange omens seem to plague her (after subsequent murders, her hair turns blood red), and someone is determined to kill her...it\\'s up to Avery to solve the mystery that lurks deep in the heart of the forest.<br /><br />The writing itself was generally smooth and enjoyable, with vivid descriptions that bring the magic of the woods to life. These verdant images contrast sharply with the rivers of blood that haunt Avery\\'s dreams. (sensitive readers beware; there are several scenes involving graphic violence). The supernatural element could have been explored in greater detail. Also, I wanted more details about Avery\\'s connection to the forest...there are hints that other members of her family share this ability. Where does it come from, and what does it mean for her future relationship with Ben?<br /><br />Unintentional or not, there are several references that point to [[ASIN:0316038377 Twilight (The Twilight Saga)]]: when Avery steps into the school office to pick up her schedule on the first day, the mysterious, beautiful new guy rushes in, refuses to look at her as she takes in his freaky silver eyes, and disappears just as quickly. Later, when she asks Ben his age, he replies \"Seventeen,\" to which Avery asks, \"Seventeen for how long?\" as her voice shakes.<br /><br />The biggest flaw for me was the villain; after developing a complex universe centered around the woods and its supernatural / spiritual heritage and infusing the story with a palpable sense of suspense and lurking evil, the final confrontation felt like a letdown. I had the urge to laugh at the absurdity of it all. The \"villain,\" once finally revealed, projects none of the sense of foreboding that shadows Avery  and her family throughout much of the novel, perhaps because his character  is mentioned so fleetingly (it seemed far likelier that another secondary character would  be the villain based on his description).<br /><br />Overall, this is a fast-paced, well-written read that beautifully describes the process of grieving and recovery in the aftermath of a brutal attack, of finding love in unexpected places, and embracing the unknown.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Venezuelan-American cookbook author Terry Hope Romero ([[ASIN:156924264X Veganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbook]]) makes Latin food vegan-friendly in Viva Vegan! This collection of 200 vegan recipes includes offerings from Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. You\\'ll find updated favorites like tostones and mofongo (Puerto Rico), stuffed arepas (Venezuela and Colombia), tamales and tortas (Mexico), ropa vieja (Cuba), ceviche (Peru), and more.<br /><br />If you\\'re new to vegan and / or Latin cuisine, fear not! Romero thoughtfully includes a primer on the vegan Latin pantry, along with numerous sidebars, suggested menus (The Buena Vegan Social Club, Colombian Colors, Buenos Aires Potluck, Sofrito So Good, etc.), and a quick-start shopping list (which can be printed at the author\\'s website) that\\'ll have you whipping up vegan delights with Latin flair in \"s&oacute;lo unos minutos\" (okay, maybe un poco m&aacute;s for some of the recipes). Quirky Spanish phrases pepper the book; they may not be grammatically correct, but they\\'re likely already familiar to non-Spanish speakers.<br /><br />Recipes are straightforward and in easy-to-read typeface; recipe names are in all-caps red, while the ingredients and steps are supplemented with tips, uses, and variations. You\\'ll find animal-free versions of staples like dulce de leche, chicharrones (instead of deep-fried pork rinds, Romero uses Chinese-style tofu; I would imagine that tofu skins would also crisp up nicely), masa dough (using vegan margarine and vegan shortening to replace the lard used in traditional tamales), and chorizo (there\\'s an included recipe for seitan chorizo, but Field Roast makes a very good (and spicy) chipotle vegan sausage that could be substituted).  If you don\\'t live in a city with a large Hispanic population, some of the items such as guava paste, masa harina and cleaned corn husks for tamales, frozen yuca chunks, and aji panca paste may be difficult to find.<br /><br />I loved the recipes I tried: the very Spanish Swiss chard with raisins and capers was fantastic! I substituted kale for the chard and golden raisins for the dark raisins and increased the fruit to ½ cup. Absolutely delicious! The oil crisps the garlic and coats the greens (I reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon), and the capers add a delightfully salty tang that contrasts beautifully with the raisins\\' sweetness.<br /><br />My second attempt was the sweet and nutty roasted stuffed plantains. They were divine, filled with a sweet-salty combo of sea salt, brown sugar, and walnuts (I\\'m vegetarian, not vegan, so I used a sprinkle of queso fresco during the last few minutes of cooking). Make sure if you\\'re roasting plantains (as opposed to frying, which works better with unripe green plantains) that their peels are almost completely black; if your plantains aren\\'t fully ripe, they won\\'t soften up as you bake them (lesson learned!).<br /><br />Like most vegan cookbooks, Viva Vegan! relies heavily on soy and wheat meat substitutes, including tofu, TVP, soy creamer / soymilk and seitan. If you\\'re allergic to soy or wheat, there are plenty of wonderful veggie and grain-based dishes like gallo pinto, red beans with Dominican-style saz&oacute;n, potato-chickpea enchiladas, and spicy tortilla casserole with roasted poblanos that you can enjoy.<br /><br />To help you wash down your newly-veganified Latin cuisine, the author provides recipes for sangria, michelada (ice-spiked beer, lime, salt and hot sauce), and the ubiquitous mojito. Sweet endings include pineapple-raisin sweet tamales (the fruit is worked into the dough), deep-fried churros con chocolate, and tropically-inspired gems such as majarete (sweet coconut corn pudding), dulce de batata, papaya-lime sorbet and sweet corn ice cream.<br /><br />The verdict: Viva Vegan! is a great addition to any kitchen and a great way to add a little \"sabor latino\" to your next meal!<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Da Capo Lifelong Books)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Fighter pilot Robin Olds was born with flying in his blood. His father Robert Olds was a captain in the Army Air Corps, and houseguests included the likes of Hap Arnold, Tooey Spaatz, Fiorello La Guardia, and other WWI pilots. When Robin\\'s mother died when he was four, he asked his father if she was in heaven with all the other airplanes. He went on his first flight at age eight. Robin entered West Point in 1940, where he combined his love of flying with football. On June 1, 1943, Robin graduated West Point and entered pilot training in the P-38 Lightning, later transitioning to the P-51 Mustang. Stationed at RAF Wattisham, he became a major and squadron commander at age 22.<br /><br />Post-war, after a brief stint as a football coach at West Point, Robin returned to flying as part of an aerobatic jet demonstration team. He missed out on the Korean War (in part due to the string-pulling by his wife, Hollywood actress Ella Raines) and was assigned to the Pentagon during the Cold War.  He finally got his chance to plunge back into aerial combat in Vietnam, where he led the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing in Ubon, Thailand. And it\\'s here that his leadership truly shone; he combined his WWII dogfighting experience with the lessons learned over two decades of active duty in the Air Force: know your mission. Know your people: what their job entails, and their role in the organization. Ask questions. Get your hands dirty (Robin learned aircraft maintenance from his crew chief Glen Wold at Wattisham). Recognize accomplishment. Accept ultimate responsibility. Foster unit spirit, but not at the expense of others.<br /><br />Robin\\'s command at 8th TAC marked a turnaround; unlike his predecessor, who\\'d only flown 12 missions in 10 months, Robin added himself to the flight schedule as a rookie, challenging his more combat-experienced pilots to train him in the F-4C Phantom. On January 2, 1967, Robin and his men launched Operation Bolo, an attempt to engage MiG-21\\'s by masquerading as F-105s. They shot down seven MiGs that day (Olds himself claimed one). To keep himself from getting rotated out after his 100 missions in Vietnam, he\\'d secretly erase missions from the board, leaving his \"official\" tally just short of 100 (he actually flew 152 combat missions over Vietnam). Despite his wishes, Robin was eventually sent Stateside, where he briefed LBJ and encountered hippies and anti-war protesters for the first time. He was promoted to Brigadier General in 1968 and relocated to Colorado Springs as commandant of the Air Force Academy. His last post was director of aerospace safety at Norton AFB, and he retired on June 1, 1973 after 30 years of service.<br /><br />Told in the first person, \"Fighter Pilot\" was completed after Robin\\'s death in 2007 by his daughter Christina and author Ed Rasimus ([[ASIN:031294876X Palace Cobra: A Fighter Pilot in the Vietnam Air War]]). Far from ghost writing, Robin\\'s gruff voice takes the lead, including plenty of colorful language and intense combat descriptions. But Robin has his share of all-too-human moments; his disintegrating marriage is a recurring theme that makes his homecomings uncomfortable (Ella refused to live on base or have her daughters attend base schools). True, there are some awkward transitions, such as when Robin loses close friends in combat or air accidents, only to be merrily moving along in the next paragraph, but overall, this reads like a conversation to a close friend (I can almost picture a group of fighter pilot aces sitting around in a bar swapping stories). It\\'s worth the price alone for the fantastic descriptions of life in wartime England and Robin\\'s first-hand account of D-Day.<br /><br />There are some black-and-white photos of Robin\\'s family, his early years during WWII, numerous photos from his time at Ubon, and a few from his later years. Included is a spectacular lithograph by Robert Taylor of Robin\\'s F-4 low-level bombing of the Thai Nguyen steel mill (although it would have had greater impact in color). However, I would have liked to see photos of the caricatures that Robin mentions several times. The thorough index also includes all squadrons, bases, and divisions mentioned in the book in addition to definitions, events, and people referenced.<br /><br />\"Fighter Pilot\" is a rollicking read that expounds on the beautiful combination of man and machine (\"You are something more than earthbound man. You are augmented and expanded by the miracle of the machine\") contrasted against the horrors of war. Robin was the true embodiment of Air Force leadership: service before self. Not just an ace pilot, he was a born leader and wasn\\'t afraid to speak his mind in defense of his men. A must-have for military and aviation buffs and a must-read for anyone in the Air Force; I hope this becomes required reading and shows up on next year\\'s CSAF Reading List.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Meh. I'm losing patience with the direction the series is taking...\",\n",
       "  'text': 'I became a fan of the Vampire Academy books for their unique take on the vampire canon: Richelle Mead\\'s vampires are either living vampires, the magic-wielding Moroi, or Strigoi, vampires that have become evil by killing humans. The Moroi are protected by dhampirs, half-human, half-vampire guardians. Their universe is heavily influenced by Russian culture: Russian-style family names, snippets of Russian, Russian Orthodox churches, and Russian folktales wind through the five books in the series. The first several books [[ASIN:159514174X Vampire Academy (Vampire Academy, Book 1)]], [[ASIN:1595141758 Frostbite (Vampire Academy, Book 2)]], and  [[ASIN:1595141979 Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy, Book 3)]] detail the bond between Rose Hathaway, dhampir Guardian-in-Training, and her Moroi charge Lissa Dragomir, last of the Dragomir royal family. Rose and Lissa share a psychic link that allows Rose to see things through Lissa\\'s eyes (but it only works in one direction). Rose is also \"shadow-kissed;\" brought back from the dead, she sees ghosts, while Lissa is a rare spirit user, able to heal grave injuries, manipulate people, and charm objects.<br /><br />In the first three books, Rose, Lissa, and some of their classmates at the Academy, including Adrian, the consummate sexy bad boy and fellow spirit user, go on a series of dangerous adventures involving Strigoi plots. These books were filled with action, plenty of kick-butt adventure, camaraderie, and hot romance between Rose and her mentor Dimitri. In [[ASIN:1595143106 Blood Promise (Vampire Academy, Book 4)]], Rose literally went to the ends of the earth trying to rescue Dimitri. Now, in Spirit Bound, the penultimate Vampire Academy book, things have taken a downhill turn for the series.<br /><br />There were simply too many improbable moments that required massive suspension of disbelief. The foremost: imagine a couple of college-aged kids getting away with an impromptu break-in at Fort Leavenworth with no one the wiser despite high security and dozens of guards. Epic fail. Or Rose\\'s turnaround on her formerly spunky, independent self: when her former relationship with Dimitri doesn\\'t have the fairytale ending she\\'d envisioned, she becomes a \"blood whore\" to Adrian for all the wrong reasons and keeps stringing the poor guy along throughout the book. Much like [[ASIN:0316067938 Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga)]], Rose\\'s supposedly-important graduation is but a flash in the pan so the novel can get down to other business. There are a lot of Moroi politics that bog the book down to the detriment of what should have been the central story. And again similar to Breaking Dawn, past characters are randomly thrown in for cameos, and then promptly disappear again with no real purpose. There\\'s also a super-high body count of Guardians and Moroi as Rose relentlessly pursues her dream of restoring Dimitri, which she pretty much shrugs off, even though those deaths were preventable.<br /><br />Spirit Bound just wasn\\'t a pageturner for me; I read it out of a sense of duty to the Rose, Lissa and other characters I knew and loved from previous entries, but the spirit of derring-do and butt-kicking that made Rose such an appealing heroine have been replaced by a moody, angry, whiny young woman who suddenly decides that the \"real world\" after graduation might be more than she wants to deal with. I\\'m hoping that the final novel [[ASIN:1595143068 Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy, Book 6)]] is an improvement over Spirit Bound.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Jennifer Lynn Barnes\\' \"Raised by Wolves\" is a fast-paced look at Were pack life from the view of an outsider. Bronwyn Alessia St. Vincent Clare (Bryn for short) is a tough-as-nails teenager raised by a pack of werewolves. Unlike them, she\\'s fully human, but alpha male Callum has Marked her as his and taken her under his wing. Like any teenager, she chafes against many of Callum\\'s restrictions (tough physical training, curfews, keeping up good grades) and just wants to be left alone to work on her artwork. Bryn carefully shields herself from the Pack\\'s shared thoughts and feral urges, especially during the full moon, and generally doesn\\'t intervene in Pack matters, but when an outside threat tears open old wounds, Bryn must examine her allegiances to the Pack and the definition of \"family.\" She\\'s obsessed with Chase, a fellow Were attack survivor, and will do anything to spend time with him, even if it risks her standing in the Pack.<br /><br />Much of the first half of the book focuses on Pack hierarchy and Pack mentality (the Weres are able to tune into each other\\'s thoughts collectively both as Wolf and human). Bryn\\'s best friend Devon comes off a bit like a token character from Glee...he\\'s a meticulously-groomed Were who lives for movie musicals and belting out showtunes. Bryn\\'s other friend Lake Mitchell lives out-of-state on the periphery of Callum\\'s territory and is a frontier gunslinger. She has the unpleasant distinction of being one of only a handful of female Weres...and the author alludes to some past sexual trauma related to this. The second half focuses on Bryn\\'s hunt for a rogue Were, and the pace picks up considerably.<br /><br />Barnes\\' writing style vaults between human thoughts and werewolf ones (generally disjointed, in brief bursts of ideas). There are also numerous episodes of graphic violence related to the central plot; it\\'s definitely gorier than a lot of other YA werewolf fiction I\\'ve read. Curiously enough, despite the intensely physical nature of Weres, most of the story is asexual. The author definitely treads into some New Age territory with psychic mind melding and being able to see the future, and I would have liked more physical descriptions of the Change (an area that [[ASIN:0385734212 Blood and Chocolate]] fleshed out nicely) that Weres undergo.  Also, the final 30 pages felt a bit anticlimactic and like a setup for an obligatory sequel.<br /><br />Overall, this is an engrossing read that fans of werewolf lore will enjoy.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I checked out Fodor\\'s Paris 2010 because I may be going to France later this year. It\\'s been eight years since my last visit to Paris, and I was looking for up-to-date information on Paris\\'s arrondissements, markets, and cultural activities. Fodor\\'s guide begins on an upbeat note by dismissing the \"rude Parisian\" myth, and the ways in which Paris has cleaned up its image in the last couple of decades: smoking laws (smoking is now banned in offices and public buildings, including hotels and restaurants), the addition of bus, bike and pedestrian lanes, an improvement in customer service, and the rise of immigration and globalization (although 34 Starbucks in Paris may NOT be such a good thing, since French caf&eacute; culture is unique).<br /><br />Fodor\\'s Paris 2010 is ideal for exploring on your own: the excellent maps include metro stops (there\\'s even a full-size removable map in the back), and many of the finds are submitted by users on the Fodor\\'s forum. It pays to read these tips, since these travelers found themselves where you soon might be. There\\'s a small section devoted to Paris with kids, with listings of kid-friendly museums, sites and shows, and great ways to wear out the kids (hiking to the top of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame). For those on a budget, there are many suggestions of free (and almost-free) activities. Included in the listings are phone numbers, hours, and websites. It\\'s always a good idea to check the website before you go, since hours are subject to change.<br /><br />Of course, haute couture and shopping in Paris is a prominent draw, and you\\'ll find Herm&egrave;s, Chanel, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent featured alongside museum stores, flea markets, vintage clothing and home d&eacute;cor. As a Dolce & Gabbana addict, I had to laugh at the brand\\'s description as \"a sexy, young-Italian-widow vibe with a side of moody boyfriend.\" One of my favorite designers, Ren&eacute; Derhy, who dabbles in exotic, vintage-style dresses, skirts and tops, isn\\'t mentioned, but he does have a boutique in the Galeries Lafayette Hausmann location.<br /><br />The photos and illustrations are first-rate, particularly the Notre Dame spread on pages 46-47. The section on the Louvre includes an illustrated timeline along with must-see items by room. There are also side trips from Paris, including Disneyland Paris and Versailles. Rounding out the book is a section on recommended books and movies about Paris (yes, [[ASIN:B0000640VO Amelie]] and [[ASIN:B00005JOC9 The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] are both there) and a small French-English glossary. The descriptions and notes are liberally sprinkled with humor (the section on Versailles is called \"Gilt Trip\").<br /><br />I loved the quirky \"fashion\" spreads that showcased a sampling of Parisian trends, such as \"La Jeune Femme\" (inspiration: Audrey Tautou), with her denim mini, ballet flats, Converse high tops and a Vanessa Bruno tote, or the sophisticated \"La Grande Dame\" (think Catherine Deneuve), with her Kelly bag and Chanel No. 5. There are even tips on how to tie scarves and do\\'s and don\\'ts of dressing in Paris (DO: wear black. DON\\'T: get a French manicure (!), dress like you\\'re going to camp, or match your shoes to your bag).<br /><br />Overall, this is a great guide that caters to a wide range of travelers, from budget (there are some hotels listed that are 80 Euros a night or less, but at the expense of no AC, no phone, no TV, no elevator, etc.) to the Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris, which will set you back a whopping 750 Euros a night and up. Similarly, dining options range from casual brasseries and neighborhood bistros to falafel, vegetarian offerings, \"hidden\" restaurants and haute cuisine. There\\'s something here for everyone, and the colorful photos and detailed maps will help you navigate with ease.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Rudy Simone\\'s \"Aspergirls: Empowering Females With Asperger Syndrome\" is a wonderful starting point for all Aspergirls, whether you\\'re an Aspergirl yourself or you have an Apergirl in your life. This thoughtfully-written guide examines the oft-overlooked Aspergirl, who\\'s been clinically ignored in favor of male Aspies (traditional figures put the boy-girl ratio at 4:1, but that is rapidly changing as 1 in 100 children are believed to be on the autism spectrum). Because Aspergirls may be better at socializing in small doses and tend to be a little more expressive than their male counterparts, they may be able to \"pass\" as neurotypical (NT) and not receive a proper AS diagnosis other than being \"shy\" or \"difficult.\"<br /><br />Simone has interviewed numerous Aspergirls regarding their experiences in all walks of life, from surviving schoolyard bullies, PTSD, and selective mutism to college, dating, motherhood and employment. She also discusses the Asperger\\'s \"is it a gift or a disability?\" debate. Each chapter ends with \"Advice to Aspergirls\" and \"Advice to Parents,\" a thoughtful touch that includes the whole family in the discussion. The book wraps up with advice from Aspergirls to Aspergirls (inspirational bullet points such as the title of this review) and the cleverly-titled \"Give Your Aspergirl some B.A.L.L.S.: Belief, Acceptance, Love, Like, and Support.\" Appendix A also features a handy chart of female Asperger traits and main female / male differences in Asperger\\'s. There is a small list of references and resources, and I was surprised not to see any of Tony Attwood\\'s books listed (although he\\'s mentioned by name several times). Simone frequently promotes her own books [[ASIN:1849058032 22 Things a Woman Must Know: If She Loves a Man With Asperger\\'s Syndrome]] and [[ASIN:1935274090 Asperger\\'s on the Job: Must-have Advice for People with Asperger\\'s or High Functioning Autism, and their Employers, Educators, and Advocates]] in nearly every chapter.<br /><br />Simone and the various interviewees put Aspie sensations into words that NTs can understand; this is in itself a feat, since our first language isn\\'t words, but images and sensations (see [[ASIN:0307739589 Thinking in Pictures (Expanded, Tie-in Edition): My Life with Autism (Vintage)]]). Simone discusses triggers (fluorescent lights, loud noises, scratchy fabrics) and meltdowns in detail, both internally and externally. In the chapter on stimming, she introduces the term \"soothing,\" which has fewer negative connotations.<br /><br />There are several chapters devoted to depression, medication, abuse and PTSD. I was particularly interested in Chapter 19, Stomach Issues and Autism. I\\'ve had digestive issues my whole life, and never previously connected AS with digestive disorders. At times, the book went into New Age-y territory, with suggestions on herbal supplements and discussions on psychic sensitivity, reiki, and chi, along with several popular AS diets, including gluten-free and casein-free (see: [[ASIN:184310055X A User Guide to the GF/CF Diet for Autism, Asperger Syndrome and AD/HD]] for more information).<br /><br />When I was younger, Aspergers wasn\\'t ever mentioned and hadn\\'t gained the widespread recognition that it currently has. I sincerely wish that this book had been available throughout my rocky adolescence; hopefully, \"Aspergirls\" will smooth the path for today\\'s young Aspergirls. If you\\'re the parent of an Aspergirl, some of the stories in this book are on the lower-functioning end of the Aspergers scale; don\\'t automatically assume that your daughter will exhibit *all* of these symptoms. Every Aspergirl is different. Just be proud of your smart, funny, and talented daughter. Or if you\\'re an Aspergirl yourself...Aspergrrrrrl power!',\n",

       "  'text': 'I took my first GRE in 2003 after completing my BA. I\\'m considering applying to a PhD program, and all the schools I looked at require a GRE score from the last five years or so, so I needed to go back to square one. I\\'m extremely weak in math skills (this was my weak point on my first GRE), and I was hoping that the Kaplan GRE Exam Premier with CD-ROM would help me review basic concepts.<br /><br />The first thing I did was to register the online companion (the code is printed inside the back cover). This unlocks a three-month trial (despite the fact that the enrollment agreement says that you\\'ll continue to have access for six months), which includes printable study sheets, GRE software for your PDA (Kaplan To Go!, which costs an additional $24.95), a few practice tests, and some short videos. Many of the \"suggested readings\" aren\\'t even online, but are in the book (it would have been helpful to have these come up when you click on them). This seems a bit deceptive, as the book\\'s cover says \"more practice questions available online every month!\" True, but only if you continue to pay for online access. However, many of the links didn\\'t work, and those that did linked directly to Kaplan\\'s GRE prep courses, which come at a hefty fee.  The included CD-ROM is Windows only, and you have to have it in the drive every time you use it.<br /><br />Now, the whole reason I wanted a GRE review book was for the quantitative section. And it\\'s sorely lacking; the math concept review section at the end of the book is about 20 pages long. Also, other reviewers have pointed out the numerous mistakes (apparently Kaplan uses actual test questions, but has rewritten them in such a way that they\\'re sometimes missing critical information). Kaplan groups GRE math into three levels: Level 1 (basic), Level 2 (skills and formulas), and Level 3. I\\'m completely deficient in Level 1, and was looking for a review of fractions, plotting points, etc. The book does not address this. It does include reviews of geometry, but I needed the basics. There are some helpful strategies on time management during the quantitative part of the test.<br /><br />The descriptions of the AWA (Analytical Writing Assessment) are somewhat better, discussing the scoring system in detail, with numerous examples. There\\'s also a list of word roots that may be helpful for some.<br /><br />There is only one full-length test included in the book, with access to six additional verbals and six quantitative tests on the CD-ROM, and access to a few more full-length tests online during your free trial. Another issue with this system is that the practice tests online are paced at one a month, meaning that you only get three additional tests before your free trial is over (the first time I logged in, it showed several tests, but now I only have one).<br /><br />Kaplan\\'s main objective is making money; it\\'s why they publish so many add-ons like [[ASIN:141955221X Kaplan GRE Exam Math Workbook]], [[ASIN:1607140527 Kaplan GRE Exam Vocabulary in a Box]], and [[ASIN:1419552198 Kaplan GRE Exam Verbal Workbook (Kaplan Gre Verbal Workbook)]] and push their online classes so heavily. I wouldn\\'t mind that attitude if the material in the book was helpful, but unfortunately I found myself confused by some of their walkthroughs of math problems, and had to keep looking up math points online as I was working through the practice problems. This might be a good choice if you\\'re fairly comfortable with vocabulary and basic / intermediate math, but if you need more in-depth review, you might be better off looking elsewhere or combining several resources.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Lonely Planet\\'s \"Discover Italy\" offers up 424 pages of insights into Italy...and due to the wealth of Italian culture and must-sees, it feels like LP\\'s barely scratched the surface. The front and back inside covers offer up thoughtful legends, business hours, conversion tables (although the exchange rate is obviously dated, as it\\'s listed as $1 US dollar = .68 Euros, when it\\'s currently .81 Euros), and language basics (including the lifesaver \"I\\'m allergic to...\" in Italian). The guide kicks off with Italy\\'s Top 25 experiences, from the obvious (Michelangelo\\'s David, St. Peter\\'s, Florence\\'s Duomo) to some I hadn\\'t put on my original itinerary: Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna, an evening stroll in Perugia, chocolate shops in Turin. Three sample itineraries are also included based on your time (5 or 10 days to two weeks).

Sections are color-coded, so you can quickly navigate to the regions that interest you. Comments and sightseeing recommendations from tour guides and Lonely Planet writers are sprinkled throughout in boxes. I particularly appreciated the \"Making the Most of Your Euro\" sidebars, which give useful tips on money-saving transportation cards and museum passes. The maps are decent, but many streets are left unlabeled. I would have preferred to see pullout maps that showed greater detail. At the rear is a directory of accommodations, from basic mountain huts in the Alps to Tuscan villa rentals. Note that these are generally association websites, not individual hotels. For that, you\\'re better off consulting Tripadvisor dot com.<br /><br />LP\\'s \"Discover Italy\" is colorful and crowded and a bit overwhelming at times; it\\'s text-heavy, and the thumbnail-sized photos don\\'t do justice to some of the artistic treasures that are showcased (Eyewitness Guides [[ASIN:0756660572 Italy (Eyewitness Travel Guides)]] excels in this area). But it\\'s a good, basic starting point if you\\'re not sure what area of Italy interests you. If you already have a particular region in mind, you\\'re better off going with a localized guidebook due to the lack of space here (most cities have only two or three hotel recommendations; ditto for recommended restaurants).',\n",

Virginia compiles three generations of Southern recipes from her grandmother Meme, her mama, and herself (trained at culinary schools in France, Virginia's recipes reflect traditional French cuisine in gratins, souffl&eacute;s, confits, sprinklings of tarragon and pots de cr&egrave;me). Frequently, recipes will be paired with their counterparts; cheese straws are next to cheesy gougeres, pot roast and brisket cozy up to boeuf bourignonne, and fried chicken and gravy share court with tarragon chicken salad and coq au vin.<br /><br />In addition to beef, pork, lamb and poultry, there are numerous seafood recipes for shrimp and grits, crawfish, gumbo, oysters and crab. The recipes call for seasonal ingredients whenever possible, and despite the meat-heavy connotations of Southern (and French) cuisine, there are numerous veggie-based dishes (cold salads, numerous preparations of okra, vegetable succotash, green beans, squash, smoky collard greens and more), particularly where tomatoes are concerned, that will take advantage of your garden or local farmer's market.<br /><br />The recipes are very clearly laid out, each with a formidable note regarding the origins of a certain recipe, oftentimes family reminiscences of her grandmother's cooking and hand-me-down kitchen utensils (the fatback recipe was fascinating; essentially skillet-fried lard, this was served as a country dinner in the past).

       "  'title': 'The haunting legacy of Henrietta Lacks',\n",
       "  'text': 'Rebecca Skloot tells the fascinating, tragic story of Henrietta Lacks, who contributed to some of science\\'s biggest advancements in the 20th century, including the polio vaccine and cancer and AIDS research. Her stored cancer cells, known as HeLa cells, are used daily around the world in various fields of medical research. Henrietta herself never knew that her cells were collected and distributed; despite the millions of dollars generated by HeLa sales (depending on the variety, some labs charge as much as $10,000 per vial), her surviving children and grandchildren never received a penny or a formal apology from Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />Lacks was descended from slaves and sharecroppers, and lived her short life working in Virginia\\'s tobacco fields and raising her five children. She started having children with her first cousin David as a teenager, and her youngest daughter Elsie was born retarded and epileptic, quite possibly from syphilis passed on to Henrietta by her husband. Elsie was institutionalized and died at fifteen. A year before Henrietta finally went to the colored ward at Johns Hopkins, she felt a lump in her cervix. She shared her fears with her girl cousins, but never went to the doctor. Soon after, she became pregnant with Joe, her fifth child. The lump was put aside until months after Joe\\'s birth, when more pressing symptoms presented themselves. Howard Jones, the gyncecologist on duty, had never seen a tumor quite like Henrietta\\'s: it was shiny and purple \"like Grape Jello\" and bled at the slightest touch.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Henrietta, Jones and his boss, Richard Wesley TeLinde, were involved in a national debate on cervical cancer. TeLinde used patients from the public wards for research, including Henrietta. Before inserting radium to treat her tumor, Jones removed two dime-sized pieces of cervical tissue: one healthy, one cancerous. He took the samples to George Gey\\'s lab, where scientists had been trying and failing to grow cell samples. But Henrietta\\'s cancer cells didn\\'t die; they multiplied at an astonishing rate, doubling every 24 hours.<br /><br />When Henrietta came back for radiation treatment, it initially appeared that her cancer was cured; doctors found no new masses, despite Henrietta\\'s complaints of pain. Doctors dismissed her claims on several other occasions, until she ended up in the hospital with a large inoperable tumor that blocked her urethra. Henrietta declined rapidly, and her abdomen was scorched black from the radiation treatments. This didn\\'t stop the spread of the tumors, which seemed to appear daily on nearly every surface. Henrietta was in excruciating pain during her two-month hospitalization; it was so acute that she was strapped to her bed to keep her from thrashing onto the floor. She died at age 31 on October 4, 1951 from acute uremia; because doctors were not able to pass a catheter into her bladder, the toxins in her urine built up in her bloodstream. During the autopsy, her body was so riddled with tumors that it appeared that she had ropes of pearls inside her abdominal cavity.<br /><br />Her four children were shuttled between relatives, where they were subjected to verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Two of them would later be involved in murder and substance abuse; all suffered from health problems and didn\\'t have adequate insurance. When Rebecca Skloot tried to meet with them in order to conduct research, she was faced with fierce initial resistance. The surviving Lackses were deeply angry, frightened and confused about the theft of their mother\\'s cells and the enormous profits that they generated for biotech companies (however, the initial samples taken by Jones and cultivated by Gey were given away to other researchers without profit); they\\'d also been hit by a con man claiming to help them research their mother\\'s hospitalization and treatment at Hopkins. But Rebecca is finally admitted into their inner circle, and tells their story largely in their own words recreated from numerous interviews and visits. She takes the time to truly help them understand the impact of their mother\\'s legacy (they had limited formal education), and to set up a Henrietta Lacks Foundation to be used as scholarship money for Henrietta\\'s grandchildren.<br /><br />The chapters shuttle between Henrietta\\'s final months in 1951 and the development of the HeLa line throughout the 1950s to today, as well as Rebecca\\'s meetings with the family in 1999-2001.  Each chapter heading has a timeline graphic clearly showing the timeframe, which helps to follow along. Henrietta\\'s enormous contribution is discussed in detail, as is the emerging field of bioethics and cloning. Several tabloid-style articles referring to HeLa merged with plant and animal cells conjure nightmarish sci-fi images of giant mice men and human plants (there are references to Jurassic Park). I was deeply interested in biology and anatomy / physiology in high school, so I had no problem following the scientific aspects of the story.<br /><br />There are numerous vintage photographs of Henrietta and her young family, the town of Clover, VA, and more recent family photos. A fairly comprehensive notes section is also included.  I couldn\\'t put the book down; Henrietta\\'s story is gripping; not just for her contribution to science, but as a vibrant portrait of a loving mother whose children never get to know her, and the deep hurts that Rebecca tries to heal.',\n",

She\\'s fiercely faithful to the hyper Issie and nerdy Devyn, who\\'s been confined to a wheelchair after a hunting accident.<br /><br />The various supernatural mythologies (yes, there are at least two major varieties of supernaturals here) are fleshed out just enough. There are no sparkly vampires. The wintry setting and brisk pacing provide genuine chills. True, it doesn\\'t win any awards for originality, but it\\'s a fun read nonetheless (and for those parents worried about the romantic scenes, fear not: it\\'s as chaste as the first Twilight).<br /><br />Fans of Twilight, [[ASIN:0061214671 Wicked Lovely (Wicked Lovely (Quality))]], and [[ASIN:0545123267 Shiver]] will feel right at home in Need.',\n",

In the third novel, Hourglass, the mysteries of Bianca\\'s birth (two vampires can only have a child with the help of wraiths, or ghosts) are slowly and painfully unraveled as she and Lucas live life on the lam.<br /><br />At the close of \"Stargazer,\" Evernight Academy was torched by the Black Cross, a powerful vampire hunting society that\\'s existed for over a millennium. Now, Bianca and Lucas must take refuge in the place that endangers Bianca the most...right in the heart of the enemy. As Bianca fights to escape detection as a vampire, she begins to experience worsening dizzy spells. Cut off from her parents and her friends at Evernight, most notably Balthazar, Bianca is uncertain what to expect from her changing body. No one ever told her what happens to a half-vampire who refuses to make the transition...<br /><br />\"Hourglass\" contains a winning blend of action and romance. Bianca\\'s world is turned upside-down; former Evernight friends become enemies, and certain former enemies lend a hand. Bianca\\'s relationship with Lucas finally heats up (tastefully). And the cliffhanger ending will leave fans on the edge of their seats until the fourth novel \"Afterlife\" comes out. Fans of [[ASIN:0316031844 The Twilight Saga Collection]] and [[ASIN:1423125959 Blue Bloods 3-Book Boxed Set]] will likely enjoy \"Hourglass.\"',\n",

Despite the premise of a talented female artist who studied under Michelangelo, \"The Creation of Eve\" focuses mainly on Spanish court life under Felipe II and Elisabeth de Valois during Spain\\'s Golden Age.<br /><br />Sofonisba Anguissola, a female Renaissance painter, left Italy in disgrace after a scandal in Michelangelo\\'s workshop and became a lady-in-waiting to Elisabeth de Valois, Felipe II\\'s third wife. The young Elisabeth has much to learn about life in the stuffy Spanish court, and must resist temptation in the form of Don Juan of Austria, Felipe\\'s half-brother. Sofonisba herself moons over that fateful night with Tiberio, another of Michelangelo\\'s apprentices, that led to her exile in Spain. She learns secondhand of Michelangelo\\'s proclivities and how his love poetry got him in hot water with the Inquisition.<br /><br />The novel details the minutiae of Spanish court life; the pecking order, elaborate fashions, foods, and dances, early medical treatments, the king\\'s numerous country palaces (several of which I visited when I lived in Spain, including Aranjuez and El Escorial), and the political intrigue that was sweeping Europe (the Inquisition, Protestantism, English piracy, Spanish discoveries in the New World, the threat of Turkish invasion).  The majority of the characters are real-life figures, including Don Carlos (Felipe\\'s son who suffered from violent mood swings after a blow to his head), Don Juan, and Catherine de Medici (Elisabeth\\'s mother).<br /><br />Sofonisba constantly moons over Tiberio (they correspond by infrequent post), the lack of opportunities for her to truly paint (she\\'s only a lady-in-waiting, not the official (male) court painter), and her (forbidden) attraction to a young Belgian doctor at the court. Her aged Italian maid Francesca is constantly following her about to prevent her from \"dishonoring\" herself (Sofonisba is thirty and unmarried).  Sofonisba becomes the preferred lady-in-waiting of Elisabeth, and is used as a shield between her and the king. Sofonisba describes her female contemporaries as \"pale uncertain Eves\" in a mirror of Michelangelo\\'s Sistine Chapel.<br /><br />I found the reading to be slow at times; the novel is written in the form of several notebooks and reads like a diary (it reminded me of[[ASIN:0439078059 Isabel: Jewel of Castilla, Spain, 1466 (The Royal Diaries)]]. Each entry is introduced with a Renaissance-era tip on grinding colors or producing medical \"cures\" such as Hungary water (some of the \"cures\" sound revolting by modern standards!). There are numerous artists discussed in detail (Michelangelo, Leonardo, Bosch, and several Flemish and Dutch artists), and if you\\'re fascinated by political intrigue and the riches of bygone courts, you\\'ll enjoy \"The Creation of Eve.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'When I was in elementary school, we would drive 800 miles to Colonial Williamsburg for spring break every year. I fell in love with the 18th-century costumes, architecture, ornate silverwork, and Baroque music. We dined at several of Colonial Williamsburg\\'s taverns: Shields, King\\'s Arms, and Christiana Campbell\\'s.<br /><br />My mom has a first-edition copy of [[ASIN:091041291X The Williamsburg Cookbook: Traditional and Contemporary Recipes]] from the 1970s, which I would pore over for hours, soaking up the line art and gross-sounding recipes (turtle soup! calf\\'s head!). The only recipe she ever made regularly was the Bourbon Balls (although she had also tried the cream of peanut soup and the chicken and dumplings).<br /><br />So when I saw that there was a new edition, \"The Colonial Williamsburg Tavern Cookbook,\" I was interested to see how the book stacked up against its predecessor. The first (and most obvious) difference is the color photos, both of finished dishes and of Colonial Williamsburg itself (the original Colonial Williamsburg cookbook was sorely lacking in photographs, and was illustrated with line art).<br /><br />The book opens with a brief discussion of colonial dining habits and \"Tavern of Colonial Williamsburg Today\" (circa 2001) before launching into appetizers, many of which prominently feature Virginia ham (melon balls, biscuits) and seafood (smoked trout, crabmeat, shrimp). Similarly, \"Soups\" also owes a debt to seafood, including chowders, crayfish soup, crab soup, and oyster bisque, with the occasional peanut, bean, or pea soup. The Kings Arms Tavern Cream of Peanut Soup was also featured in the original cookbook and in a flyer handed out in Colonial Williamsburg; it was one of my family\\'s favorites during our visits to Williamsburg, and the home version tastes every bit as good as the original. The texture is almost like a thick gravy, made by softening vegetables in stock, then straining the mixture and mixing in smooth peanut butter and cream over low heat.<br /><br />In fact, many of the recipes in the Colonial Williamsburg Tavern Cookbook are taken verbatim from the first edition, right down to the sidebars. Many of the dishes are identical: King\\'s Arms Tavern chicken pot pie, Chowning\\'s Tavern Brunswick stew, Sally Lunn bread, and tenderloin of beef stuffed with oysters, for example. Others have been updated for the better: the bourbon balls now call for melted chocolate in place of cocoa, and have doubled the bourbon (the original called for a scant ¼ cup). The Shields Tavern carrot pudding spiced with cardamom has swapped cardamom for the original nutmeg, ditched the cream sherry and halved the sugar.<br /><br />The most striking addition to this new version is the number of vegetarian-friendly vegetable and egg dishes, including grilled polenta, carrots glazed with two gingers, bean and corn succotash, mushrooms in cream sauce, and spinach pie. Southern staples such as grits and pickled watermelon rind also make appearances. The most noticeable absence is the lack of any nutritional information about the included recipes; no statistics on calories, fat, sugar or sodium are to be found. Like their forebears, these recipes are quite generous with butter, cream and shortening at times. Also, some of the ingredients may not be readily available in your area (fresh rabbit, scuppernong wine, chutney, cardamom, arrowroot).<br /><br />Overall, this is a worthy souvenir for those who have dined at one of Colonial Williamsburg\\'s taverns, or for those who enjoy collecting cookbooks. The beautiful photography adds to the experience, although not all photographs are labeled. The historical notes make for interesting reading, and the recipes themselves are fairly straightforward and easy to follow. However, if you already own the original \"The Williamsburg Cookbook,\" be aware that many of the recipes here are direct copies, with few if any tweaks or adjustments.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Ben Mikaelsen\\'s Touching Spirit Bear is the gripping tale of Cole Matthews, juvenile delinquent who\\'s about to be sentenced to jail time for assaulting a fellow student. Tough-as-nails Cole feels like the world is out to get him and it\\'s his right to smash senseless all who defy him; his alcoholic father beats him, and his alcoholic mother enables it by keeping silent. Cole blames everyone but himself for his anger.<br /><br />Cole\\'s Tlingit parole officer Garvey insists on trying an alternative to jail time called Circle Justice. This ancient healing ritual is based on the Native American / First Nations practice of having the accused perform a vision quest and community service in order to address the roots of his anger and to try and offset the harm he\\'s caused. Cole puts on a show, hoping that the yearlong banishment on an Alaskan island offers the chance to escape.<br /><br />Once on the remote Alaskan island, Cole lashes out and seeks escape, only to find himself stranded and angry. He runs into a large white bear: a Spirit Bear, an animal sacred to Native Americans. Cole is outraged that the bear doesn\\'t fear him, and attempts to kill it with devastating consequences.<br /><br />The remainder of Touching Spirit Bear chronicles Cole\\'s rehabilitation from his injuries, along with his newfound empathy towards Peter, the student whom he assaulted. Peter is left with permanent brain damage and severe depression, and Cole thinks he knows a way to help him get over his fear and anger.<br /><br />Touching Spirit Bear is at heart a story of wilderness survival, but it also teaches respect for one\\'s ancestors and for nature. Cole learns to dance animal dances based on creatures he\\'s observed in the wilderness; each improvised dance teaches him some strength of the animal. He soaks in a freezing pond to still his thoughts and carries a large stone up a hill, representing his ancestors, then rolls it down, releasing his anger. This might sound preachy and touchy-feely, but it works in the harsh context of the wilderness as Cole gradually learns to control his anger. The Tlingit (Garvey and Edwin) aren\\'t represented as \"perfect\"; each is atoning for some crime committed in the past. Garvey in particular served five years in jail and wasn\\'t offered the healing that Circle Justice provides.<br /><br />The story does contain some graphic moments (the brutal beating of Peter, Cole\\'s mauling), but uses violence sparingly. The powerful nature imagery really brought the story to life. This would be a good pick for those who enjoy wilderness survival tales such as [[ASIN:1416936475 Hatchet]], [[ASIN:0786272546 Island of the Blue Dolphins]] or [[ASIN:0060540958 Julie of the Wolves (rack)]].',\n",

Rose is dhampir, the offspring of a human and vampire. Lissa is Moroi, a mortal vampire with magical powers (the Strigoi are evil immortal vampires that kill to survive).  Rose is Lissa's Guardian, sworn to protect her at any cost. Her wants and needs come second to Lissa's. Rose and Lissa have been best friends since childhood, and she'd never questioned the cost of giving up her personal life to protect Lissa, but now she's haunted by a growing sense of resentment. After the death of a friend, Rose is troubled by dark thoughts and impulses and her crush on the handsome teacher Dimitri spirals out of control.<br /><br />I hadn't read any of the previous novels in the series before picking up Shadow Kiss, but even so, Mead makes the backstory accessible to new readers. Rose is a captivating narrator, strong-willed and impulsive. Her blossoming relationship with Dimitri is handled tactfully, and provides a sweet counterpoint to the violence that is unleashed upon St. Vladimir's. In many ways, St. Vladimir's presents all of the typical high school drama: cliques, catty remarks, annoying teachers, drunken parties, but with the element of magic and vampiric royalty. It's much more three-dimensional than some other recent vampire young adult fiction. The story is gripping and kept me reading until the last heart-wrenching page, and I rushed out to discover the continuing story in [[ASIN:1595141987 Blood Promise (Vampire Academy, Book 4)]].\",\n",

I loved the album, but wasn't sure how the sheet music would translate.<br /><br />Published by Alfred Music, Worrisome Heart features nine of the ten album tracks (the album closer Goodnite was more of a sonic unwinding than a song) in the same sequence, beginning with Worrisome Heart. The song translates well to a piano-only medium, retaining its bluesy vibe (the piano picks up the bass part along with the piano melody). The acoustic guitar melody of All That I Need Is Love translates to the right-hand melody, while the Norah Jonesesque acoustic guitar of Sweet Memory is again picked up by the piano to impressive effect. The chilling cascade of notes opening Love Me Like A River Does is preserved, closing with the playful Goodnite. The left hand has some tricky rhythmic sections that mark time, so you may have to resort to a metronome to capture the exact timing that gives the songs their jazzy flavor.<br /><br />Overall, the piano transcription retains all the original character of the recorded tracks, with the right hand picking up the various melody lines of the acoustic guitar. The piano-only versions are impressively complete (complete with clearly marked tempos and bluesy grace notes) and blissfully easy to master (I would rate this as intermediate). Lyrics and guitar tabs are also included (there are also violin and other solos marked on several songs). There's not a lot of artwork other than some black-and-white photos of Melody in the endpieces, putting the focus squarely on the music.\",\n",

As the novel opens, Eva, who relocated from Ireland to pursue her musical dreams, has a painful debut which results in a rush to the hospital (the full impact of this isn\\'t revealed until the end of the novel). Afterwards, dulled by painkillers, she sets out into the night and meets Daniel in a hotel bar. Daniel, a handsome Latino investment banker, seems destined to be a one-night stand, but will play a significant role in Eva\\'s life. Soon after, Eva runs into Alexander, a sketchy \"antiques\" dealer from Chechnya, who shows her what he says is an undiscovered Stradivarius.  Every fiber of Eva\\'s being is burning to possess the marvelous instrument, leading her into a web of deception that grows ever larger until the novel\\'s climax. She resorts to lying to gather up the huge sum of six hundred thousand dollars that Alexander is asking. There\\'s even a bit of globetrotting as Eva flies to concerts in Cologne and back home to Ireland. I didn\\'t get as much of a feel for New York City as a leading role, though; most of the action takes place in Eva\\'s apartment or in concert halls, with few recognizable landmarks.<br /><br />The cast of characters, including Eva\\'s parents, her love interests, her nosy New York neighbor, and her rival / roommate Valentina, really brings the story to vivid life. Eva is dealing with her own personal demons, including a breakup, insecurity, and the fallout from her late father\\'s disappearance. The purchase of the \"Magdalena,\" as Eva dubbed it, marks the rapid unraveling of her previous life.

The recipe introductions are written in italics, which also made it hard to read (the recipes themselves are in New Roman). As a cookbook,  I don\\'t see myself using this too often in the kitchen. Granted, Tess covers staples like polenta (several variations) and pasta, but many of the seafood dishes (which make up the bulk of the book) were too exotic for me (either in the preparation or the ingredients). The staples of Venice are all here, especially salted cod (baccala), pork with milk, brasato con amarone, and eel. Seafood examples include fish carpaccio (yes, like sashimi, these are ultra-thin slices of raw fish with pink peppercorns), eel, and preparations of baby octopus, along with clams, crab and squid. There are gnocchi and risottos (seafood, vegetable) and pastas (including squid ink, which I love from living in Spain), vegetable side dishes, and desserts. The recipes are arranged as in an Italian meal, starting with the Venetian equivalent of tapas (cicchetti), followed by antipasti, zuppa/pasta/gnocchi, risotto, secondi, contorni, and dolci. Several drink recipes (including the bellini, pomegranate, and Rossini) are also included.<br /><br />Overall I kept feeling like the recipes were an afterthought to the reminiscences and glorious photos of Venice\\'s Baroque decadence, which is unfortunate, since I loved \"Falling Cloudberries\" and have read many good reviews of [[ASIN:1552857328 Twelve: A Tuscan Cook Book]]. As a coffee table travel book, Tessa offers up romantic, dreamlike snippets that float alongside photos of men and women dressed in Baroque finery.

There are some fun basic cookies like the secret ingredient chocolate chip cookies (crushed corn flakes), chewy oatmeal cookies (dressed up with dried cranberries), peanut butter, milk chocolate toffee bars (quick, easy, and oh-so-yummy), and brownie s\\'mores.

       "  'text': 'Cat Connelly lives a perfectly safe - if boring - existence. The daughter of an Irish father and an Italian mother, she\\'s spent her life being who she thought others wanted her to be: organized, responsible, and always there to cook, clean, or dole out money in a bind.  She works at a New York accounting firm for the money and health benefits, but her true love is digital photography. She has serious issues due to her mother\\'s lengthy absence during her adolescence, and at thirty-five, she\\'s still single and has serious commitment issues. She hasn\\'t taken a vacation in years, but after a very public humiliation by her senile Irish grandmother, Cat ends up in Rome, a city she last visited as an exchange student thirteen years ago.<br /><br />Once in Rome, Cat struggles to understand what\\'s keeping her in the Eternal City after a series of unplanned disasters derail her plans. It\\'s certainly not Francesco, her former flame. The handsome Marco has the annoying habit of calling Cat \"Princess Ann\" and making constant references to Roman Holiday even though she\\'s never seen the movie (Cat\\'s grandparents were extras, and even named her mother Audrey Hepburn Verdicchio), but there\\'s little action on the romantic front. And Cat\\'s afraid to contact her Roman family, whom she hasn\\'t heard from since her mother\\'s death nearly two decades ago.<br /><br />Over the course of four weeks, Cat makes peace with the ghosts that haunt her. At the same time, she rediscovers the timeless charms of everyday life in Rome, dodging Italian stallions and eating like a princess, capturing slices of everyday life through the lens of her [[ASIN:B000GHVZQ0 Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)]]. Harmel turns the narrative into a glowing travelogue, a sort of off-the-beaten-path Rome that\\'s enchanting and refreshing. The descriptions of Karina\\'s cooking are mouthwatering, and several recipes mentioned in the book are included: cheese fondue, rice-stuffed tomatoes, Margherita pizza, creamy risotto, and panzanella salad. Most are vegetarian (the risotto calls for chicken broth, but vegetable broth could easily be substituted), all are easy to prepare and perfect for a light summer meal on the patio (or piazza).<br /><br />Some of the plot twists were a bit too convenient for my tastes, but overall this is a light summer read that\\'s a perfect escape from daily life full of the sights, sounds, and smells of Italy. Much of the story centers on [[ASIN:B00003CXCD Roman Holiday (Special Collector\\'s Edition)]], right down to the cover photo of an attractive brunette with an Audreyesque bob on the back of a Vespa, so if you haven\\'t seen the film, it\\'s the perfect accompaniment, along with a glass of Prosecco. There are romantic elements, but the real story is on Cat\\'s self-discovery and the mystery of her mother.  The title is a bit misleading, though; Cat doesn\\'t speak Italian and doesn\\'t really make an attempt to learn to do so.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Kitty Pangborn, shamus\\'s assistant to Dex Theroux ([[ASIN:0312377703 Death Was the Other Woman: A Mystery]]), gets to meet the man of her silver screen dreams while on a case: Hollywood leading man Laird Wyndham is accused of murder, and it\\'s up to Kitty, Dex, and Mustard (their driver and \"procurement\" specialist) to get to the bottom of the accusations. Kitty finds it hard to distance herself professionally; she\\'s terminally star-struck at meeting Laird in person, so much so that she forgets to take notes (she\\'s seen every film he starred in). But Kitty and Dex quickly dig up some unsavory truths on Laird\\'s offscreen persona; an estranged wife, a jilted lover and several employees paint a less-than-glowing picture of a man with a hot temper and lusty appetites that know no boundaries.<br /><br />The behind-the-scenes views of the 1930s-era film studios (and Production Code politics) are fascinating, and there\\'s a moment of sheer comedic genius as Kitty goes undercover as an extra in a futuristic sci-fi film. Depression- and Prohibition-era LA play less of a starring role in \"Death Was In The Picture,\" although architecture is still described in detail, and there are frequent mentions of Okies and the down-and-out. Kitty\\'s own domestic life is largely absent, other than Marjorie\\'s attempts to create dishes out of unappetizing substitutes when cash is low. She has her moment to shine in a designer Jean Patou silk beaded dress at a swank party, and does a lot of detective work trying to sniff out the truth behind Laird Wyndham and the sinister Xander Dean.

       "  'text': 'I loved Nancy Haddock\\'s [[ASIN:042521995X La Vida Vampire (Oldest City Vampire, Book 1)]]; the heroine Cesca is a very hip, snarky gal who loves surfing and home decorating, works as a ghost tour guide, and oh, happens to be a vampire who hates blood (it makes her queasy, and she\\'ll only drink caramel macchiato-flavored blood from Starbloods). In \"Last Vampire Standing,\" Cesca ends up aiding Jo-Jo, a fugitive vamp who seeks to be America\\'s next greatest comic and also serves as Cesca\\'s instructor for flying lessons. The original novel was snappy and funny, but \"Last Vampire Standing\" never gets off the ground, much like Cesca\\'s attempts at flight.<br /><br />Part of the plot is a carryover from \"La Vida Vampire\": Cesca\\'s girlhood crush on Triton plays a role in \"Last Vampire Standing,\" and Pandora the shapeshifter is back, as is Cesca\\'s love interest, Deke Saber. Now for the bad: the numerous plot threads dangle (example: a major character makes an appearance in the first twenty pages, and isn\\'t heard from again until Chapter 21). I just wasn\\'t interested in the several weak side plots. The novel dragged along; sexual innuendo and bedroom romps serve as frequent page filler rather than actual action or intrigue (sort of parallel to Charlaine Harris\\'s Southern Vampire Series\\' slide into Sookie\\'s bedroom antics). I realize that this is a paranormal romance, but Cesca was an innocent, blushing vampire virgin in the first book; she seems to have been attending Kama Sutra cram sessions in the interim. We do get to see more of Cesca\\'s psychic powers in use, but there are no other vampire powers at work (the flying lessons were a definite dud). The flashbacks to Cesca\\'s human life were well-drawn; I would have liked to hear more historical details from early St. Augustine.<br /><br />Jo-Jo is a weak, annoying character. You\\'d think after centuries of experience as a court jester, he\\'d have picked up some remotely funny one-liners, but no. He doesn\\'t really serve much of a purpose; although he swears to serve as Cesca\\'s protector, he\\'s never around after getting a contract with a high-powered agent and ditching Cesca for Leno and Oprah (amazing, since the guy has ZERO talent except for the vampire novelty factor). The novel\\'s baddies are just mere sketches, here and then gone, and the central plot point appears in one chapter and is never fully explored. There is some good material here, but it needed to be more developed (the various plots lack cohesiveness and the secondary characters are forgettable). I really wanted to like this after loving \"La Vida Vampire,\" but it was a struggle to finish reading it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Sarah Dunant, author of [[ASIN:0812974042 In the Company of the Courtesan: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:0812968972 The Birth of Venus: A Novel]], brings us the lives of cloistered nuns in \"Sacred Hearts.\" Set in 1570 Ferrara, \"Sacred Hearts\" follows the paths of two very different women: the gentle, inquisitive Suora Zuana, who runs the dispensary and is in charge of the convent\\'s medicinal gardens, and Serafina, a fiery sixteen-year-old incarcerated against her will after a tryst with a music teacher. Many of the women in the Santa Caterina convent entered the convent because of physical or mental disability, illicit romances, or simply because of the exorbitant dowries demanded by the era.<br /><br />The intricate social hierarchy of the convent is drawn out in detail, as are the numerous \"overlooked\" forbidden items such as makeup, mirrors, and other worldly symbols of vanity. The exacting schedule of prayers creates the daily order of the nuns\\' lives, embellished by the rare performance or concert for the convent\\'s benefactors. The abbess, Madonna Chiara, has spent nearly her whole life within the convent\\'s walls, but has a wisdom and grace that reach far beyond her limited experience with the outside world.<br /><br />The abbess has her hands full dealing with several complicated issues: the elderly, barely alive Suora Magdalena sees visions, which drives the young novices into a frenzy. Suora Umiliana seeks to usurp the abbess\\'s position by scourging the convent from ungodly influences and encourages harsh fasting and visions. And Serafina rages and lashes out against her confinement, trying to be reunited with Jacopo. Zuana treats Serafina like the daughter she will never possess.<br /><br />Zuana is the main narrator, and she is an interesting figure: she only entered the convent because she was ill-suited for marriage, and despite a rich education in herbal medicine and anatomy from her father, as a woman she could never attend a university. She put her father\\'s herbal cures to use, and is guided by his voice. She admits to never having religious visions, and knows that she does not pray as often as she should, but she finds comfort in the spirituality of nature. Serafina\\'s rebellious nature is a challenge to her, even though it seems that the girl has promise as an assistant. Zuana finds herself softening, bending rules that she never would have questioned before. Serafina undergoes an apparently miraculous transformation from rebellious spitfire to docile penitent. The novel also highlights the dark realities of religious hysteria (miracles, stigmata, voluntary starvation and self-harm to bring on visions) that plagued convents.<br /><br />Despite the rich layers of detail that bring the austere convent life into sharp focus, \"Sacred Hearts\" was a very slow read and I almost put it down for good on several occasions. Time slows to a crawl during the lengthy segments dealing with illness and the prescribed herbal remedies, Serafina\\'s drug-induced hallucinations and physical torments, and religious politics. Normally, I\\'m a huge fan of historical fiction (historical art fiction in particular), but \"Sacred Hearts\" just didn\\'t hold my attention.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bryant Terry\\'s \"Vegan Soul Kitchen,\" on the heels of [[ASIN:1585424595 Grub: Ideas for an Urban Organic Kitchen]], attempts a healthy makeover of soul food staples like pickled watermelon rinds, cornbread, collard greens, peach cobbler, grits, coleslaw and potato salad, accompanied by extensive playlists taken from jazz, soul and R&B. The book\\'s subtitle, \"Creative African-American Cuisine,\" is where \"Vegan Soul Kitchen\" truly shines: these aren\\'t just stripped-down recipes with animal products removed, but instead draw on traditional African and African-American influences to create new soul food classics.<br /><br />The ingredients and instructions are straightforward; each recipe is prefaced by a brief introduction about its origin and/or inspiration. Most of the ingredients should be easy to locate (fresh, preferably organic produce). Depending on your personal nutritional views, you may or may not want to substitute for the large amounts of coconut oil and coconut butter called for in several recipes (coconut oil is frequently promoted as a health food, but is very high in saturated fat). There are useful sidebars on home canning, how to cook dried beans, and specific ingredients (okra, kombu, tempeh). I especially liked the chapter on Margie\\'s cupboard, which features useful staples like garlic olive oil, sauces and marinades, plum ketchup, relishes, salsa and pickles. Surprising use of flavor really makes recipes shine, like the Italian-influenced basil sea salt and rosemary oil, or an Asian vibe from coconut milk, ginger and tamari.<br /><br />The first recipe that I tried was the Citrus Collards with Raisins Redux. I ended up substituting dried cherries for the raisins. The garlic seemed to overpower the greens; next time, I\\'ll try this with one clove instead of two. Also, I didn\\'t squeeze out enough of the water after rinsing the greens, making them slimy (my fault). The next recipe was the lavender lemonade. I\\'d purchased a bag of culinary lavender, and was looking for a way to use it up. I was initially apprehensive about boiling a quarter-cup of lavender buds, which turned the water a scary green-gray color after ten minutes. But the resulting lemonade (sweetened with agave nectar) was refreshing and not too sweet, with a certain floral hint from the lavender (but not strong enough that you could immediately identify it). This is a definite hit for those hot summer afternoons on the front porch. The drinks section (\"Hydro Game\") really shines, with refreshing twists such as Sparkling Rosemary Lemon-Limeade, Pure Strawberry Pop, and Sweet, Sour, and Spicy Blackberry Limeade that are refreshing alternatives to processed sodas. The third recipe that I tried was the coconut rice; it makes a quick and refreshing side dish (or breakfast!) and can be thrown together in a matter of minutes if you have rice and coconut milk on hand. Other great sides include Roasted Red Potato Salad with Parsley-Pine Nut Pesto, Caramelized Grapefruit, Avocado, and Watercress Salad with Grapefruit Vinaigrette, and Roasted Sweet Potato Puree with Coconut Milk.<br /><br />I would have liked to see nutritional info and perhaps a few more photos illustrating dishes (the few color photos are located in the center of the book instead of spread out throughout the chapters), but overall \"Vegan Soul Kitchen\" offers up tasty dishes, along with some great recommendations in music, books, films and artwork that complement the chosen recipe themes (Louis Jordan\\'s [[ASIN:B000V68QZO Beans And Cornbread]] with Red Beans and Brown Rice with Red Wine-Simmered Seitan, Herbie Hancock\\'s [[ASIN:B00137SPDS Watermelon Man]] for Watermelon Slices with Basil Sea Salt). This is a good starting point for those seeking to transition to a vegetarian / vegan diet (although there is a chapter devoted to tempeh, tofu and seitan, most recipes are soy-free); Terry also includes a few of his favorite cookbooks, including [[ASIN:0609804898 The Voluptuous Vegan: More Than 200 Sinfully Delicious Recipes for Meatless, Eggless, and Dairy-Free Meals]], [[ASIN:156924264X Veganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbook]], [[ASIN:0231146388 Hog and Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America (Arts and Traditions of the Table: Perspectives on Culinary History)]] and [[ASIN:0060852569 Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life (P.S.)]].<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Da Capo Press)',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hyder Ali, a retired clerk, is driving his patient wife crazy with his post-retirement boredom. They are a Muslim couple living in Visakhapatnam (Vizag), a coastal city in Andhra Pradesh in eastern India. His only son, Rehman, is a political activist dedicated to helping India\\'s exploited, which gets him into trouble with the police (and his father). Mr. Ali decides to start a marriage bureau to earn extra income, and in doing so, finds unexpected happiness and reconciliation.<br /><br />Mr. Ali, aided by his shrewd wife, quickly gains numerous clients seeking arranged marriages. Farahad Zama does a great job of easing Western readers into India\\'s complicated caste system, along with its many restrictions, without departing from the story and events at hand. Some of the families insist on the unobtainable (the perfect wife: beautiful, pale complexion, English-speaking, rich, matching caste, or a software engineer husband in California), but Mr. Ali is able to match several successfully.<br /><br />The two main foci are the situation with Mr. Ali\\'s son Rehman, who is arrested for participating in a political protest, and the unfortunate situation of Mr. Ali\\'s young secretary Aruna, who was forced to drop out of graduate school due to her father\\'s prolonged illness and their precarious economic situation. The narratives weave together seamlessly, along with the fruits of Mr. and Mrs. Ali\\'s matchmaking prowess.<br /><br />Indian culture is the real star here: the contrast between ancient traditions and modernity. We\\'re given a taste of how Vizag\\'s Christians, Muslims, and Hindus live side by side, of the intricacies of Muslim and Hindu weddings, and the sprawling Indian bureaucracy. There are numerous culinary delights, from rooh afza to idli, coconut chutney, and prasaadam. The author thoughtfully includes several cultural primers masquerading as Mrs. Ali\\'s English \"essays\" that give the reader a background into Vizag, the caste system and Urdu and Telugu words for extended family. It reminded me of the recent excellent Vine selection [[ASIN:1416583688 The Case of the Missing Servant: A Vish Puri Mystery]], another novel set in India that also dealt with Indian arranged marriages and Indian culture and customs.<br /><br />A delightful, sparkling read that is full of moments of humor and unexpected tenderness, \"The Marriage Bureau for Rich People\" showcases both the good and bad of modern India: corruption and poverty tempered by quiet generosity and strong communities. Romantic and light without being cloying, this is a perfect summer read that fans of Indian culture will be sure to enjoy.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Dead and Gone, the ninth installment in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series, is both a curse and a blessing. Let's start with the good news first: the blessing is that it's a quick, breezy read (I finished it in a couple of hours). The curse is that the plot is lightweight, many of the characters are throwaway, and the book reaches a new level of graphic violence on par with HBO's [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]] adaptation.<br /><br />As I've noted in the most recent Southern Vampire novels, Sookie is starting to show her age. She's currently without a love life; she's sworn off Bill after discovering his treachery, she broke off her relationship with weretiger Quinn, and Eric seems to want to claim her for her own (finally, we get some more Eric action!).  In Dead and Gone, Sookie is once again called upon to discover the perpetrator of a gruesome crime when one of her shifter acquaintances is found brutally murdered behind Merlotte's. Like the vampires before them, the Weres have also decided to go mainstream, and this may be the reason behind the death. There's also a secondary plot involving Sookie's fairy connections through her great-grandfather Niall, and of a brewing war between rival fairy factions that threatens Sookie and everyone that she loves.<br /><br />The main problem with Dead and Gone is that little time is given to what is supposed to be a central theme. Sure, Sookie's fairy heritage has been revealed in bits and pieces over several books, but in Dead and Gone, this plays a central role yet little is revealed about Harris's fairy culture other than the fact that Sookie is constantly in danger.<br />Regarding the level of violence, the bodies pile up with little rhyme or reason; characters that have been present in several books are handily dispatched for no apparent reason other than to generate  collateral damage. Several pregnant women are murdered. There are also graphic depictions of crucifixion and torture that may be disturbing to some readers.<br /><br />The narrative is disjointed and contains numerous errors regarding events in earlier books. The biggest flaw is the lack of interest; too much time is spent on the initial murder while the real battle is anticlimactic. The numerous red herrings (Octavia discovering a long-lost flame and moving out, former friend Arlene's betrayal that nearly results in Sookie's demise, Quinn's single appearance, Sookie mentioning her nephew Hunter only twice) only serve to fill pages and do nothing to advance the backstory or the action. Dead and Gone isn't a total loss, but it's not an engrossing read either, more of a beach book that's good for summer afternoons. Yes, it reads quickly, but I felt like precious little had actually occurred in 300 pages. I can only hope that the next installment sees a deeper story and more character development.\",\n",

Her parents and grandmother are Jewish immigrants from Russia, but Rebecca and her four brothers and sisters were born and raised in the US. In \"Meet Rebecca,\" we\\'re introduced to Rebecca\\'s family and Jewish home life. Rebecca\\'s bubbe (grandmother) is very religious and her family observes Shabbos (the Sabbath), but her father must work on Saturday to make ends meet, which displeases her bubbe. Bubbe is also scandalized by the fact that Rebecca\\'s cousin Max (Moyshe) is a struggling actor. Rebecca\\'s passion is moving pictures; she adores the Perils of Pauline and longs to go to a real movie. Her cousin Max encourages her, and Rebecca tries out a performance of her own with unpredicatable results.<br /><br />Rebecca always feels left out; her older twin sisters Sadie and Sophie always get to light the Sabbath candles and check the challah bread. Rebecca is desperate for her own set of candlesticks to prove that she knows the Hebrew blessing and is old enough to participate, and seeks to find a way to raise enough money.<br /><br />There\\'s also trouble back home in Russia, where her Uncle Jacob and his family are trapped. Their daughter Ana is very sick, and the Russian army is conscripting boys as young as twelve. Rebecca\\'s father, a shoe salesman, struggles to raise the $175 it will take for steamer tickets for the family.<br /><br />Judaism plays a central role in Rebecca\\'s life, and the author does a good job of incorporating Jewish culture and traditions into the story (lighting the Sabbath candles, Sabbath restrictions, pushkes, mitzvahs, bar mitzvah). The immigrant experience is also central to the story, and Ellis Island is touched upon. I found it a bit unlikely that Rebecca\\'s immigrant parents would speak mostly English at home; most likely, her parents and grandmother would continue to use Yiddish as the home language, with English being the school language.<br /><br />The section on America in 1914 was particularly useful and included numerous bits of trivia about the conditions in Russia (pogroms), the immigrant experience in New York, Yiddish culture, and early movies and newsreels. There\\'s also a glossary of Yiddish and Hebrew words. Overall, this is a nice introduction to American Girl\\'s newest historical character and a good overview of the 20th-century immigrant experience that\\'s accessible for younger readers.',\n",

Their self-described style is \"farm girl meets Fifth Avenue,\" a blend of retro country-inspired chic and simple yet delicious cooking. Their story has been featured in Country Living, and the book\\'s foreword is by Nancy Soriano, the editor-in-chief of Country Living (the cookbook also comes with a free year\\'s subscription to Country Living). The book\\'s introduction includes Teri and Serena\\'s stories and their inspirations in the kitchen and beyond.<br /><br />Beginning with breakfast, the Farm Chicks offer up simple yet tasty renditions of favorites such as cinnamon rolls, Nancy\\'s nutmeg coffee cake (it\\'s best served warm, as the bottom crust becomes very crunchy when cool), the delightfully exotic cardamom griddle cakes with maple cardamom cream, maple oat scones, and the guilty pleasure of a golden potato bake jazzed up with sharp cheddar. Craft ideas in this section include a scone cozy made out of terrycloth and a paint-by-numbers tray.<br /><br />Appetizers include some upscale ideas such as parmesan rice-stuffed mushrooms, sweet onion tartlets, and grilled cumin chicken with apricot dipping sauce. For lunch, the girls serve up roasted chicken and pesto hoagies, tortellini and Italian sausage soup, and more exotic offerings such as Asian quinoa salad and spinach, feta, and beet salad.<br /><br />Vegetarians like myself will also find many options, such as veggie pitas, pesto pasta salad, \\'mater sandwiches, tangy cucumber cups, and sour cream and onion zucchini cakes. Other non-veg recipes can easily be tweaked to become vegetarian (replace chicken broth with veggie broth in the parmesan rice-stuffed mushrooms, cheesy potato soup, savory sweet potato soup, and Asian quinoa salad).<br /><br />Desserts round out the savory offerings with a sweet finale, and this is where the cookbook shines. Such gems as dark chocolate butter cake, emboldened with cinnamon, espresso, and Dutch cocoa powder, and a large section on pies (including primers on baked pie shells, dough, and how to create a perfect piecrust) make piemaking approachable for new home cooks and old hands alike. Nutritional info (including protein, fat, carbs, fiber, sodium, cholesterol, and calorie info) is included for each recipe, and the Farm Chicks encourage you to write your own notes in the book regarding substitutions.<br /><br />The included recipes and crafts are simple and straightforward, making them approachable for working and stay-at-home moms (or dads!) alike. The craft ideas are cute and affordable, many using items that you may already have around the house: making aprons out of old sheets, cookbook jackets out of unused shower curtains or vinyl tablecloths, and a countertop utensil holder using a vintage glass jar wrapped in colorful oilcloth. The book also includes a reusable stencil of the Farm Chicks\\' signature polka-dotted apron and a one-year subscription to Country Living, making this a great gift idea.<br /><br />(Review copy courtesy of Sterling Publishing)',\n",

       "  'title': 'A beautiful collection of seasonal recipes from Vera Bradley and friends',\n",
       "  'text': 'I first saw the Vera Bradley: Cooking with Friends cookbook on vacation in Michigan last year, and recently snapped up a copy at our local Vera Bradley store. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased additional copies as gifts. A collection of recipes from company founders, employees, and family friends, \"Cooking With Friends\" is a treasure trove of elegant yet fairly simple recipes that are perfect for any occasion. Arranged by season, there are suggestions for themed dining (Easter brunch, Mother\\'s Day, Cinco de Mayo, bridal luncheon, seaside dinner, tree trimming party, etc.) and beautifully staged photographs that feature Vera Bradley linens and accessories (but not distractingly so).<br /><br />The wide range of recipes will appeal to all tastes, from comfort food such as chicken enchiladas and divine mac and cheese to elegant appetizers made with caviar and creative (alcoholic) drinks. The recipes themselves are clearly written, and many include insights into the creators or origins. There are delightful twists, such as the guacamole and feta cheese dip (page 21), summer coconut mojito (page 51), salsa-baked goat cheese (page 65), green tea soda with fresh fruit (page 97), Lake Gage chili (page 107), and smoky chipotle hummus with garlic bagel chips (page 166). Most of the ingredients should already be in your pantry or fridge, making it a breeze to throw these delightful gems together for a quick get-together. There\\'s also a wine selection guide, recipes by category, and a handy substitution guide that includes healthy (lower-fat) substitutions.<br /><br />Printed in England on heavy, high gloss paper, this will become a treasured addition to your cookbook collection and makes a beautiful gift.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Based on Jan Karon's Mitford series, the Mitford Cookbook is a rich collection of recipes featured in her Mitford novels. For those not familiar with the Mitford series, the stories revolve around Father Tim's parish in Mitford, North Carolina, and the townsfolk that he comes to know and love. Food plays a central role in many stories, including Esther's famous orange marmalade cake. Numerous fans kept asking Jan for recipes, and she had to work in reverse, hiring chefs to create recipes based on her books.<br /><br />Not only does the Mitford Cookbook contain important starring recipes, but it also includes beautifully staged food photographs, illustrations, snippets taken from the various novels that complement each recipe, a previously unpublished Mitford story, kitchen hints from Karon, her own kitchen memories of her grandmother, and vintage family photos that really make this a keepsake.<br /><br />The recipes range from comfort food (Father Tim's meatloaf, Puny's macaroni and cheese, Mama's biscuits) to Southern staples (fried okra, cornbread, fried chicken, greens) to more upscale creations such as Helene's roast poulet with currants, buche de noel, and roasted red pepper rouille with cracked pepper toast. The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out, with the number of servings in the upper corner of the page. This is comfort food at its best, and the numerous blessings and prayers sprinkled throughout make it food for the soul as well as the stomach.<br /><br />This is a beautiful gift for fans of the Mitford books or anyone who appreciates a beautiful, practical, and easy-to-use cookbook. It's as much fun to read the various excerpts as it is to sample the recipes (Esther's showstopping orange marmalade cake is definitely worth the work; a friend made it for my birthday this year, and it was divine), and will become a cherished keepsake in your family.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'A beautiful, heartbreaking look at love and loss in prerevolutionary Iran',\n",
       "  'text': 'Mahbod Seraji\\'s haunting \"Rooftops of Tehran\" is set in 1973 Tehran, in an exotic world where families gather on carpeted rooftops to escape the heat and humidity of the day, weaving stories and poems late into the starry nights. Seventeen-year-old Pasha Shahed is a bookworm who harbors a secret crush on his beautiful neighbor Zari. At first, he keeps this forbidden desire locked firmly away since Zari is engaged to Doctor, a university student with dangerously Marxist political leanings. But when Doctor is forced to go on the run after catching the eye of SAVAK, the Shah\\'s secret police, Pasha finds himself drawn to Zari like a moth to a flame.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the novel unfolds several years before the Revolution, the political atmosphere is charged, with thousands imprisoned, tortured and killed for suspected subversive political activities and affiliations. The SAVAK are everywhere. Pasha and Zari are caught up in this tempest with devastating effects for all involved; during the Shah\\'s birthday motorcade, a single defiant statement by Zari shatters Pasha\\'s world.<br /><br />Pasha must recover from both the physical and psychological scars in the aftermath, and his only hope of escape is studying in the United States. He and his parents struggle to make sense of the violence and palpable fear that has crept into their lives, of nighttime raids and friends that disappear forever. Pasha\\'s friendship with Ahmed becomes a lifeline as Pasha struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts in the wake of his many personal losses.<br /><br />Seraji\\'s Tehran is beautifully described, and threads of Iranian culture are woven throughout; Iranian poets, celebrations (No Ruz), and traditions  create a rich cultural tapestry that provides vibrant color to Pasha\\'s tale. Pasha makes an engaging narrator, and touches of humor lighten otherwise dark moments ( Pasha\\'s mother\\'s  disgusting herbal \"tonics\" that are supposed to cure him of his introverted nature,  \"Professor\" Ahmed\\'s \"scholarly\" treatise on the dangers of self-pleasure). This is a must-read by a fresh new voice, and particularly insightful given the current political situation in Iran thirty years after the Revolution.  A short interview with the author and a reader\\'s guide are also included.',\n",

       "  'title': 'A fleeting, delicate tale as light as rosewater',\n",
       "  'text': 'In \"Rosewater and Soda Bread,\" Marsha Mehran\\'s followup to [[ASIN:0812972481 Pomegranate Soup: A Novel]], the Aminpour sisters Marjan, Bahar, and Layla continue their adventures in West Ireland circa 1987, a year after they opened their Iranian restaurant Babylon Cafe. After fleeing personal tragedies in Revolutionary Iran, the sisters seek some sense of normalcy in their new homeland. They\\'ve managed to make the Babylon Café successful despite the meddling of Dervla Quigly, a bossy and dour \"moral guardian\" who detests anyone (or anything) foreign and is determined to cause trouble, and against the will of Thomas McGuire, who, like his counterpart from [[ASIN:0552998486 Chocolat]], broke into their restaurant and attempted to destroy their livelihood.<br /><br />Marjan, the eldest, acts as the protector of her younger siblings after their parents died. She finds herself distanced and unable to open up to a man who shows interest in her, while her sister Bahar, who suffered unspeakable trauma at the hands of her sadistic husband while still in Iran, secretly clings to the Catholic religion. Brassy Layla wants to \"go all the way\" with her boyfriend Malachy, going as far as asking Marjan to order \"protection.\"<br /><br />In the middle of these domestic dramas, a crisis is unfolding in their sleepy village: a beautiful young woman washes up on the shore suffering from internal injuries. She\\'s found naked, won\\'t or can\\'t speak, and her fingers are mysteriously webbed like a mermaid\\'s. Her savior is the elderly Italian immigrant Estelle Delmonico, who at her advanced age is alone, childless, and crippled with arthritis.<br /><br />Yet other secondary characters from \"Pomegranate Soup\" make appearances, but if you haven\\'t read the first novel, these names (and subplots) are forgettable. The material feels more like a short story than a full-length novel, and the origins of the mysterious \"mermaid\" are only briefly touched upon towards the very end; indeed, her actual origins seem anticlimactic after the risks and dangers that Marjan, Estelle, and others take to conceal and protect the girl from the Irish authorities.<br /><br />Despite the lightweight subplots, \"Rosewater and Soda Bread\" is a delightfully told tale of food (luscious descriptions and recipes of Persian cuisine), culture (Irish as well as Persian), the mysteries of religion and the heart, and the deep bonds of sisterhood. It\\'s a read that fans of [[ASIN:0552998486 Chocolat]], [[ASIN:038542017X Like Water for Chocolate: A Novel in Monthly Installments with Recipes, Romances, and Home Remedies]] and [[ASIN:0553590324 Garden Spells (Bantam Discovery)]] will enjoy.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Ever felt like there\\'s a nagging voice in your head? Well, if you\\'re Penelope Thornton-McClure, that \"voice\" is the very dead private dick Jack Shepard, who hasn\\'t had a body since getting iced in 1949. Jack haunts Pen\\'s bookstore Buy the Book and aids her in solving mysteries; in The Ghost and the Femme Fatale, the small town of Quindicott has its hands full with its first-ever Film Noir festival. Leading lady Hedda Geist, out of the limelight for decades after the grisly death of her studio boss Irving Vreen, is scheduled to make an appearance, but her first return to the stage is nearly her last.<br /><br />Penelope, her aunt, and Jack are hot on the trail when festival guests turn up dead, leading them to uncover a decades-old tale of steamy affairs and cold-blooded murder. Snappy pacing, humor, and even a touch of romance between the hard-boiled Jack with his \"iron jaw\" and Penelope (the two \"time travel\" through dreams in order to investigate). Jack\\'s language is pure pulp fiction / noir, and the touches from the 1940s were nice. This is the same author who pens the Coffeehouse Mysteries, and I loved the take-charge Pen, the sexy Jack, and the quirky cast of supporting characters. The mystery included enough twists and turns that I didn\\'t even suspect the real villain until the shocking (and appropriately noirish) finale. This was the first book in the series that I read (it\\'s number four), and I can\\'t wait to devour the further adventures of Jack and Pen (I\\'d like to see their romance heat up!).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Fashion-conscious Kelly expects her study abroad in Rome to turn her into a designer superstar, but fate has other plans in store. When Kelly and her friend Sheela land in Rome, they find out that a) they\\'re NOT staying in some grand villa, b) the rooms are super-tiny, c) they\\'re on the fifth floor (and NO elevator) and d) the air conditioning doesn\\'t work.<br /><br />Kelly can\\'t seem to make friends with her suitemates Marina (\"Goth Girl\"), vegan Lisa, or timid Minnie, so she takes up dating the fast and dangerous Joe, a blond surfer type who always seems to find trouble wherever he goes. This leads to very serious consequences for all involved; Joe\\'s stunts result in expulsion for at least one student.<br />In fact, out of the several S.A.S.S. books I\\'ve read, this is the first one that features noticeable drug use.<br /><br />Kelly has real artistic talent, but she can\\'t seem to get her personal life together once in Rome. She\\'s constantly late to classes after breaking curfew every night with Joe, misses assignments, and is refused entrance to the Vatican because of her skimpy clothing. But after a pivotal event mid-book, she cleans up her act (although it appears that she never learns Italian) and tries to make the most out of the time that she has left.<br /><br />Peggy Guthart Strauss includes lots of great details about daily life in Italy, particularly in her descriptions of artwork, and maybe more importantly, Italian food! Kelly gets to visit various regions of Italy, including stops in Tuscany, Naples, and Pompeii. During the course of the summer, she learns that appearance isn\\'t everything; she loosens up and learns to enjoy the company of her new classmates, even if they\\'re not the sort of people that she would hang out with back home in Chicago. She also stands up to the bullying Joe after he makes fun of her new friends. This was a quick, entertaining read that really brought modern Italy to life.',\n",

I say that bc if you look at the seal pics you can see the tell tale line at the bottom of the page.  As someone who has made many photocopies of pages in my time so I could try out different colors & mediums that black line is a dead giveaway to me. It’s on other pages too.  The entire book just seems off. Nothing is sharp & clear. There is what looks like toner dust on all the pages making them look muddy.  There are no sharp lines & there is no clear definition.  At least there isn’t in my copy.  And the Coloring Book for Adult on the bottom of the front cover annoys me. Why is it singular & not plural?  They usually say coloring book for kids or coloring book for kids & adults or coloring book for adults- plural.  Lol  Plus it would work for kids if you can get over the grey scale nature of it.  Personally I’m not going to waste expensive pens & paints trying to paint over the grey & black mess.  I grew up in SW Florida minutes from the beaches & I was really excited about the sea life in this. I hope the printers & designers figure out how to clean up the mess bc some of the designs are really cute. They just aren’t worth my time to hand trace & transfer them, but I’m sure there are ppl that will be up to the challenge.  This is one is a hard no. Going back. I tried.'}\n",

No bent edges, no buckled covers, no marred printing, no mysterious liquids, & no folded pages. The book is lovely, but my continued pet peeve with books like this is the manufacturer’s insistence of printing on both sides of the damned pages. So you can’t frame one picture without losing the image on the other side. It’s annoying.  I’d gladly pay more for a book with printed images on only one side & on watercolor grade papers.  So instead I guess I will be yanking these out, scanning them, & printing them on my own watercolor papers so that I can use the images on both sides.  The paper just does not hold up to a lot of media of you choose to use both sides in my experience. Ever.  I believe I now own all, but one of JD books & I will be buying it for myself for Mother’s Day. Lol. I love her art. I love her stamps. I love this book, but I’m knocking a star bc printing on both sides is stupid imo when the book is meant to be used to create more art.  Why limit the artists by making us choose which side to use for framing or which side to use if we choose to cut one side up & decoupage it onto something. We are then paying double for half a book!  It’s insane imo. Give the buyers options other than creating more work like I mentioned with the breaking the book apart & scanning it for personal use & printing it on better papers.'}\n",

I have several of her books now & I fully intend to buy more for myself, my 5 kids, & my grandkids. We all love arts & crafts & these books are just awesome. My only issue is I haven’t brought myself to work in them yet! Lol. I use a separate sketch book!  I’m old school. Taught never to write in books or deface them. The only time I do is if the grammar or punctuation is wrong or the idiot author has now said the killer has blue eyes where previously they said green. Plot errors drive me crazy. Those times I will fix the mistakes. Lol.  So I’m hoping to bring myself to actually work & draw in the books. Lol.  I’m hoping she makes a lot more of them.'}\n",

I expected all jungle animals so finding papayas, figs, coconuts, & pineapples seems like another cop out. If I wanted a fruit book I’d have bought one!  These pages appear thinner too. You can see the images from the artwork on the other sides bleed through. I love the artist & her work, but I’m very disappointed with this book. It’s a measly 64 pages & 4 of the projects (the fruit) I will never paint in my lifetime.  There are so many animals she could have put in here like zebras, lions, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, alligators, crocodiles, & ostriches etc instead of the stupid fruit.  Poorly executed in book content & length, but lovely artwork on the good ones.  Not worth $23 ever imo.  I gave it 3 stars bc it’s not worth the price since it’s half the book of her previous ones & the content is lacking for art projects.'}\n",

He had scrawled Joseph on the front inside cover (nearly illegible as he was 4! and only a mom would recognize it!) and Sophia was irritated thinking her little sister was disrespecting her books.

I have several books for review and this one is my personal favorite. Some of my professors loan this text out to students, but I prefer 24/7 availability in my own home! :-) Happy studying, future nurses!<br /><br />UPDATE: I saw sooo many reviewers having trouble getting to the online content to take system-specific quizzes that I decided to post instructions here on how to get to the right place.<br /><br />1) Go to the Pearson Pegasus log-in page once you\\'ve set up online access, and log in.<br />2) Click on the book title on the left side of the website.<br />3) On the next page, on the left side near the top, you will see a menu bar that has the following options: \"Today\\'s View, Course Content, Grades, Communicate\". Look just BELOW this menu bar and you will see the following options: \"View All Content, Course Calendar, Learning Objectives.\"<br />4) Click on Learning Objectives.<br />5) On the left side, you will see the following options: \"Client Need, Topics Areas, Integrated Process.\"<br />6) To take quizzes related to your system or topic of choice, click the plus sign for \"Topics Areas\".<br />7) Click on your system of choice.<br />8) On the right side, there are several options for that topic of study. Scroll down to the bottom-ish. You will see a heading called \"Self Study\" for that topic of study. Click on it.<br />9) A separate pop-up window will appear so that you may begin your quiz.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to comment below.
